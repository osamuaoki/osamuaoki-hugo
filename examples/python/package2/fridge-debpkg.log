W: fridge: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/jane
N:
N:    Each binary in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /sbin or /usr/games should
N:    have a manual page
N:
N:    Note that though the man program has the capability to check for several
N:    program names in the NAMES section, each of these programs should have
N:    its own manual page (a symbolic link to the appropriate manual page is
N:    sufficient) because other manual page viewers such as xman or tkman
N:    don't support this.
N:
N:    If the name of the man page differs from the binary by case, man may be
N:    able to find it anyway; however, it is still best practice to make the
N:    case of the man page match the case of the binary.
N:
N:    If the man pages are provided by another package on which this package
N:    depends, lintian may not be able to determine that man pages are
N:    available. In this case, after confirming that all binaries do have man
N:    pages after this package and its dependencies are installed, please add
N:    a lintian override.

N:
N:    Packages with Python scripts should depend on the package python. Those
N:    with scripts that specify a specific version of Python must depend on
N:    that version of Python (exactly).
N:
N:    For example, if a script in the package uses #!/usr/bin/python, the
N:    package needs a dependency on python. If a script uses
N:    #!/usr/bin/python2.6, the package needs a dependency on python2.6. A
N:    dependency on python (>= 2.6) is not correct, since later versions of
N:    Python may not provide the /usr/bin/python2.6 binary.
N:
N:    If you are using debhelper, adding ${python:Depends} to the Depends
N:    field and ensuring dh_pysupport or dh_pycentral are run during the build
N:    should take care of adding the correct dependency.
N:
N:    In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends,
N:    will be more appropriate.
