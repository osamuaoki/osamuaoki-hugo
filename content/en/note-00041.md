## High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF)

[High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format) is used by iPhone with its file extension `.HEIC`.

Here are tips to cope with HEIF image files on Debian.

### HEIF to JPEG conversion

You can convert a HEIF image file to JPEG by installing `libheif-examples` package.

```
$ heif-convert foo.HEIF foo.JPEG
```
### Eye of GNOME Image Viewer

Eye of GNOME Image Viewer (`eog` package) can support to display HEIF image files by installing `heif-gdk-pixbuf` package.

### GIMP

GIMP supports HEIF image files using `libheif1` package.

### Shotwell

Shotwell 0.30 in Debian/bookworm doesn't support HEIF image files.

Install Shotwell 0.32.1 or newer [flatpack package from Gnome upstream](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell/BuildingAndInstalling).
