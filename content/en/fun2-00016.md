## GNOME

The choice of the best GUI program practice is not simple since there are many
choices for GUI platforms, many outdated documentations, new features without
updated tutorials, and future uncertainties.

Despite people had very negative reaction to the GNOME3 due to its new default
user experience, I chose it as my GUI example platform for its fundamental
internal technical merits.  We can always customize the user experience part.

Here is my best effort to capture the recent GUI framework history for GNOME
and best sources for references.  (The latest stable is GNOME3.4 as of 2012 Summer.)

### GNOME history

[GTK+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+) is the GUI toolkit for
[GNOME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) and is build on the top of C with
[GLib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLib) and
[GObject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject).  It requires many chores with
boiler plate macro definitions when used directly from a C program.  Its
modularity as a GUI toolkit has evolved roughly as follows.

* GTK+1.0 (1998): just separated from [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/about/ancient_history.html).
* GTK+1.2 (1999): reasonable shape for general applications.
* GTK+2.0 (2002): for GNOME2 based on GLib, GObject, GIO, ATK, GDK, GdkPixbuff
* GTK+3.0 (2011): for GNOME3 based on GLib, GObject, GIO, ATK, GDK, GdkPixbuff, [Pango](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pango)
    * GTK+3.0 works with [Cairo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_(graphics)), [Clutter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter_(toolkit)), and [GObject-introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/), ...

[GNOME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) has evolved significantly with its
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication[inter-process
communication (IPC)] structure.  Its history is roughly as follows.

* GNOME1 (1999): [CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA) (= [Bonobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(component_model)) + libIDL + ORBit) as IPC established.
* GNOME2 (2002): Antialiased fonts, UNICODE support (internationalization), HIG compliance (accessibility), ...
    * GNOME2 cycle: IPC migrated from CORBA to [D-Bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus).
* GNOME3 (2011): D-Bus as IPC established. ([CORBA deprecated](http://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/2.32/bonobo-corba.html.en))
    * GNOME3 cycle: [GObject-Introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/) is introduced.
      * [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) is becoming a popular choice to write applications for the native binary target instead of traditional and complicated C code with many boiler plate macro definitions.
      * [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) with [PyGObject](https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject) is a popular choice to write applications under the high level interpreter language with [JIT compilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation).
      * [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is becoming the choice for the embedded language of applications with the [Gjs](https://live.gnome.org/Gjs) binding.

GNOME3 applications are just plain GTK+3 applications.  There is no code bloat
by [CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA) any more.

https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Users[The language binding system
based on GObject-Introspection] can provide:

* tighter binding including the memory management than the generic language binding systems such as [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) can, and
* more consistent binding across different languages.

GObject-Introspection xml data of each library can be found under the `/usr/share/gir-1.0` directory.


## Glib and GObject

Dynamic memory management using `malloc()` etc. is a big headache when coding
with C.:

* [Virtual Memory Allocation And Paging in The GNU C Library manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Memory.html)
* [C dynamic memory allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation) (Wikipedia)
* [mmap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap) (Wikipedia)

Such complication can be avoided using libraries such as Glib and GObject.

GLib is a general-purpose utility library, which provides many useful data
types, macros, type conversions, string utilities, file utilities, a mainloop
abstraction, utility data structures, and so on.  

`GString` offered in GLib is a data structure and associated methods offering
text buffers which grow automatically as text is added with the proper dynamic
memory management.

Source to convert to upper case.


{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/upper.c" >}}


If we try to guess the library name and header location, it is not easy to get them right.

Manual failed compilation

{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/upper-ng.log" >}}


Many modern libraries provide `*.pc` files in their development packages.  You
can use it with `pkg-config` to get proper compilation options for the glib
library.  Let's look for such thing for `glib`.

Search the development package of Glib

{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/glib-apt.log" >}}


If the `libglib2.0-dev` package has not been installed, install it now.

Search the right `*.pc` file for Glib for use with `pkg-config`.

Search the right *.pc file for Glib

{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/glib-dpkg.log" >}}


The `glib-2.0.pc` file is the right file.  

The glib-2.0.pc file found on the Debian wheezy system.

{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/glib-2.0.pc" >}}


The right compile and link options used by Glib is given as follows.

{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/glib-pkg-config.log" >}}


TIP: The Debian wheezy system on amd64 architecture has its `*.pc` file at
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/glib-2.0.pc`.  Please note the additional
Multi-Arch specific `/x86_64-linux-gnu/` in its path.

By using this, the `upper.c` program can be compiled without error.

By adding the `-v` option, the compilation details are exposed.

Compilation of upper.c with Glib with the -v option

{{< snippet "examples/lib/glib/upper-v.log" >}}


When reading [GLib Reference Manual](http://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/)
(via web or `devhelp`) and the source of GLib, please note that GLib is written
using its own fundamental type system.

You can also find a code which manages reference counted objects in Linux
kernel:

* [The zen of kobjects (2003)](https://lwn.net/Articles/51437/)
* [Everything you never wanted to know about kobjects, ksets, and ktypes](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kobject.txt)

These looks very much like Gobject.


### Fundamental fixed size data types

GLib uses its own fixed size data types.

* Types prefixed by "g" which are equivalent of ones in standard C
    * `gchar` `gint` `gshort` `glong` `gfloat` `gdouble`
* Unsined types prefixed by "gu" which are equivalent of unsined ones in standard C
    * `guchar` `guint` `gushort` `gulong`
* Integer types with platform independent specified bit size
    * `gint8` `guint8` `gint16` `guint16` `gint32` `guint32` `gint64` `guint64`
* Untyped pointer alias
    * `gpointer`: C99 type `void*`
    * `gconstpointer`: C99 type `const void*`
* New types which are not part of standard C
    * `gboolean`: value=TRUE or FALSE
    * `gsize`: C99 unsigned integer type `size_t` (usually 64bit or 32bit)
    * `gssize`: C99 signed integer type `ssize_t` (usually 64bit or 32bit)
    * `goffset`: C99 type `off64_t`
    * `gintptr`: C99 type `intptr_t`
    * `guintptr`: C99 type `uintptr_t`

### Fundamental variable size data types

Glib offers its own variable size data types with associated routines such as
memory allocation for many utility data structures such as `GString`.

* `GList`: Doubly-Linked Lists -- linked lists that can be iterated over in both directions
* `GSList`: Singly-Linked Lists -- linked lists that can be iterated in one direction
* `GQueue`: Double-ended Queues -- double-ended queue data structure
* `GSequence`: Sequences -- scalable lists
* `GTrashStack`: Trash Stacks -- maintain a stack of unused allocated memory chunks
* `GHashTable`: Hash Tables -- associations between keys and values so that given a key the value can be found quickly
* `GString`: Strings -- text buffers which grow automatically as text is added
* `GStringChunk`: String Chunks -- efficient storage of groups of strings
* `GArray`: Arrays -- arrays of arbitrary elements which grow automatically as elements are added
* `GPtrArray`: Pointer Arrays -- arrays of pointers to any type of data, which grow automatically as new elements are added
* `GByteArray`: Byte Arrays -- arrays of bytes
* `GTree`: Balanced Binary Trees -- a sorted collection of key/value pairs optimized for searching and traversing in order
* `GNode`: N-ary Trees -- trees of data with any number of branches
* `GQuark`: Quarks -- a 2-way association between a string and a unique integer identifier
* `GData`: Keyed Data Lists -- lists of data elements which are accessible by a string or GQuark identifier
    * `Datasets` -- associate groups of data elements with particular memory locations
* `GVariantType`: GVariantType -- introduction to the GVariant type system
* `GVariant`: GVariant -- strongly typed value datatype
    * `GVariant Format Strings` -- varargs conversion of GVariants
    * `GVariant Text Format` -- textual representation of GVariants

## GObject

GObject provides a generic type system to register arbitrary single-inherited
flat and deep derived types as well as interfaces for structured types in C on
top of GLib fundamental data types.

C with GLib and GObject offers an alternative to C++ with its Standard library
although it requires many chores with
http://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gtype-conventions.html[boiler plate
macro definitions].

The GTK+ GUI toolkit is build on the top of C with GLib and GObject.  If you
wish to simplify this coding process, please think about Vala.  For more see
the following section on this document and the followings:

## GTK+3

Although we are at GTK+3, we have many older documentations for GTK+2 but not enough ones for GTK+3.

Those older documentations for GTK+2 contain useful contents as long as they are used carefully.

For pure C programs, migrating from GTK+2 to GTK3+ is basically as easy as
changing from "gtk+-2.0" to "gtk+-3.0" in `pkg-config` argument.  In case of
troubles such as missing `GtkObject` and many missing GDK API issues, see
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/migrating.html[GTK+ 3 Reference Manual:
Part V. Migrating from Previous Versions of GTK+].

Here are basic references:

* [GTK+ (wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+)
* [GTK+ (upstream doc)](http://www.gtk.org/documentation.php), or via `devhelp`
* [GTK+ 3 Reference Manual](http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/index.html)

## Glade

[Glade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glade_Interface_Designer) is the UI design
tool for GTK+.  Its output is an XML file and can be loaded directly to GTK+.
If you wish to simplify the GUI coding process with many UI widgets under any
language, please think about using Glade.

See:

* [Glade Tutorials](https://live.gnome.org/Glade/Tutorials) (pointers)
    * [Tips and tutorials related to GTK+ toolkit](http://blog.borovsak.si/) (2009-2010)
    * [GTK+ and Glade3 GUI Programming Tutorial](http://www.micahcarrick.com/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-1.html) (2007)
    * [GTK+ 2.0 Tree View Tutorial](http://scentric.net/tutorial/treeview-tutorial.html) (2005)
    * [Glade Catalog Tutorial](http://virtualex.linuxoid.net/2009/08/18/glade-catalog-tutorial/) (2009)
* [Glade User Interface Designer Reference Manual](http://developer.gnome.org/gladeui/3.6/) (API for Glade 3.6)

    * Learn how to use Glade GUI from video.
    * Disregard details of Python code since it is based on gtk.Builder from PyGTK for GTK+2 and outdated.

## PyGObject

Python bindings of GTK+ has evolved.

* PyGTK for GTK+2: (deprecated))
    * starting code with "`import pygtk`" (newer), or "`import gtk`" (older) 
* PyGObject for GTK+3: (recommended)
    * starting code with "`from gi.repository import Gtk`" (current)

So we focus on the latest PyGObject for GTK+3 and recommend you to start with:

* [The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (2012)

Unfortunately, as of 2012 on Debian wheezy, we can not find good reference
documentations of GTK+3 and its related libraries for Python.  

We can create a usable reference documentation of GTK+3 and related libraries
by yourself using the `g-ir-doc-tool` command from the gobject-introspection
package as explained in
https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Doctools[GObject Introspection
Doctools].  

```
$ g-ir-doc-tool --language Python -o ./output_dir /usr/share/gir-1.0/Gtk-3.0.gir
$ yelp ./output_dir/index.page
```

Despite the efforts to make GTK+3 PyGObject as compatible to the older GTK+2
PyGTK as possible, the differences are still huge.  See
http://pfrields.fedorapeople.org/presentations/OhioLF2011/PyGObject.pdf[Graduating
to GUI (PDF)].

Please note older PyGTK for GTK+2 are still used widely as of now.  The new
GTK+3 Python codes using PyGObject such as `accerciser`, `caribou-preferences`,
`gdebi-gtk`, `gnome-shell-timer-config`, `software-center`, and
`software-properties-gtk` provide us with good examples.

## Vala

Vala is a programming language specifically designed to ease the traditional C
coding process for GNOME3. The Vala compiler generates C codes using the object system of GNOME with GLib, GObject, etc.  Vala offers capabilities such as:

* access to the modern object oriented language features such as `class`,
* access to the automatic memory management system based on the reference counting,
* access to all C libraries, and
* generation of native binaries with the C API.

Writing codes for GNOME with the plain C is very tedious and error prone
process. But Writing codes for GNOME in Vala is very simple and straigtfrward
process just like writing codes under high-level languages such as Python,
Java, or MONO/C#.

TIP: Vala does not free you from thinking in C.  Think Vala as a nice pre-processor.

Let's start here:

* [Vala Tutorial](https://live.gnome.org/Vala/Tutorial)
* [Valadoc Online API Documentation](http://valadoc.org/#!wiki=index)

In Vala, GLib and GObject objects are available as default.  Almost any
libraries written in C can be accessed from Vala by declaring `using ...;` at
the top using Vala bindings defined as VAPI files located in the `/usr/share/vala*/vapi/` directory.

<!--
  method using GI file made with `vala-gen-introspect` seems to be obsoleted
-->

[Vala binding to GObject-based libraries](https://live.gnome.org/Vala/Bindings) are generated automatically as:

* generating GObject Introspection GIR file (stored in the `/usr/share/gir-1.0` directory)
* generation the VAPI binding from the GIR file with `vapigen`
* tweaking the binding generation with metadata and custom code
* their VAPI files contain "generated by vapigen" in it.

https://live.gnome.org/Vala/ExternalBindings[Vala binding to non-GObject-based
C libraries] are manually generated and their VAPI files do not contain
"generated by vapigen" in it.

The C API is always available in the pertinent manpage, info page, or
documentations accessed via `devhelp`.  But Vala API is a bit difficult to get
at this moment and explained as below.

C API names of many libraries are mapped to Vala ones with the similar naming
convention as GLib naming convention as:

* C API: `g_topic_foobar()`
* Vala API: `GLib.Topic.foobar()`

The exact mapping from C API names to Vala ones is defined in `*.vapi` (Vala
API) files found in `/usr/share/vala*/vapi/`.  For example, on Debian wheezy:

* Glib: `/usr/share/vala-0.16/vapi/glib-2.0.vapi`
* GObject: `/usr/share/vala-0.16/vapi/gobject-2.0.vapi`
* GTK+: `/usr/share/vala-0.16/vapi/gtk+-3.0.vapi`
* POSIX: `/usr/share/vala-0.16/vapi/posix.vapi` (libc/libm library)
* CURSES: `/usr/share/vala-0.16/vapi/curses.vapi` (curses library)

These `*.vapi` (Vala API) files are written in Vala language with extensive use
of the [attributes](https://live.gnome.org/Vala/Manual/Attributes) such as
`CCode`.  Here are some cliches used in `*.vapi` files:

* `[CCode (cprefix ...)]`
    * This is primarily used for namespaces. While when left to its
   own devices valac will simply concatenate the parent names to
   generate C type names, setting the `cprefix` allows you to
   override this. For instance, assuming you have a class
   `Foo.Bar.Baz`, setting a cprefix of "`Fubar`" on a your `Bar`
   namespace will result in a C name of "`FubarBaz`" for the `Baz`
   class.
* `[CCode (lower_case_cprefix ...)]`
    * This overrides everything up to the start of
   the method name. For instance, a method named `Foo.Bar.baz` would
   normally result in a C name of `foo_bar_baz`. However, if you set
   the `lower_case_cprefix` of the `bar` class to be "`fb_`", the
   resulting C name would be "`fb_baz`".
* `[CCode (cname ...)]`
    * This sets the C name to exactly what you specify here. For
   instance, if you set the `cname` of a `Foo.Bar.baz` method to
   "`bacon`", the name of the `Foo.Bar.baz` function in C will be
   "`bacon`".

Here are some reminders for errors when using Gtk.Builder with Vala.

* Forgetting to use `[CCode (instance_pos = -1)]` when using instance
  methods instead of static methods as handlers

* Forgetting to mangle the handler method names in Glade, e.g. from
  `FooBar.my_handler` to `foo_bar_my_handler`

* Not using the right signature for the handler. One missing parameter
  or one parameter too much will result in a segmentation fault.

Let me explain the last case a bit more.  If the signal signature is

```
public class Area : Object {
    public signal void clicked (int x, int y);
}
```

then the handler method must have *exactly* these parameters in order
to work with Gtk.Builder's auto-connect:

```

public void on_clicked (Area source, int x, int y) { }
```

Vala can't recognize this mistake, because auto-connection happens at
runtime an it doesn't know at compile-time which method will be connected
to which signal.
