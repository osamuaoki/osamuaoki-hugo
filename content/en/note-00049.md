Here is a memo to use LXD on Debian 12 (bookworm).

## Tools for containers

There are several ecosystems to use the Linux container.

- https://ubuntu.com/lxd
  - GITHUB: https://github.com/canonical/lxd
- https://github.com/lxc
  - GITHUB: https://linuxcontainers.org/
- https://virt-manager.org/
  - GITHUB: https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager
- https://podman.io/
  - GITHUB: https://github.com/containers

  - GITHUB: https://github.com/moby/moby

- [Containers](https://github.com/containers) -- Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, conmon-rs, crun https://podman.io/
- [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) -- https://mobyproject.org/
- Containers](https://github.com/containers) -- Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, conmon-rs, crun





We're a collection of open source tools that create, configure, and work with containers.


Some of our tools include Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, conmon-rs, crun, Podman Desktop and youki, just to name a few. We also have several supporting libraries for these tools, such as common, storage, image, and more. Check them out and see all the cool things happening!


There are many tool sets to use kernel space Linux Container capabilities.

* LXD container manages the Linux Container through `liblxc.so.1` library
* docker  the Linux Container managed through `liblxc.so.1` library


* LXD is a system container and virtual machine manager.
  * `lxd` is the LXD container and virtual machine manager (daemon)
  * For virtual machines, `lxd` is used with `--vm`.
* LXC is LXD container userspace tools.
  * `lxc` is CLI for LXD container


for the system container.

qmk (kvm) is CLI for the virtual machine.
