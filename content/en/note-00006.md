Although the migration from X to wayland is mostly transparent to the end-user
like me, there are some exceptions.

## How to check if an application uses wayland or X

* Execute "`xeyes &`" from a terminal console .
* Move mouse pointer over to an application in question.
* If eyes are responsive, it's an X application.
* If eyes aren't responsive, it's a wayland application.

You need to have `x11-apps` package installed.

## How to reassign Caps-key as CTRL-key under Wayland.

GNOME Tweaks does the job for you.  (Dah, obvious.  Please don't try to do this
via `xmodmap`(1).

For Linux console, you need to change `loadkeys`(1).
