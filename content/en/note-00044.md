Since 2022, tricks written in [Keyboard shortcut customization (GNOME Settings)](https://osamuaoki.github.io/en/2021/01/15/debian-usability/#keyboard-shortcut-customization-gnome-settings) stopped working for me.   This is my memo to update it to the current working state.

## Keyboad shortcuts stopped working

This breakage seemed to have happened with changes made in 2022.


| *package* | *bullseye* (2021) | *bookworm* (2023) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `gnome-shell` | `3.38.6-1~deb11u1` | `43.4-1` |

GNOME post-40 releases have major changes from previous ones.

My initial reaction to brokage of trick method was this may be caused by changes of javascript codes in gnome-shell.

## Where in gnome-shell package can I find its javascript codes?

Older documentation such as
"[GNOME shell: Javascript Source Documentation (extensions development)](http://mathematicalcoffee.blogspot.com/2012/09/gnome-shell-javascript-source.html)"
written in 2012 talks about javascript codes in `/usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui`.
But I don't see them on my system.

Then I found
"[Where are gnome-shell's UI javascript files on Ubuntu 20.04](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1305948/where-are-gnome-shells-ui-javascript-files-on-ubuntu-20-04)"
written in 2020.

Now the whole javascript codes are packed into
`/usr/lib/gnome-shell/libgnome-shell.so`. The javascript codes can be found in
the original source tree or retrieved from installed
`/usr/lib/gnome-shell/libgnome-shell.so` using `gresource` command.

## Are there any changes in related javascript codes in gnome-shell.


Let's check the original source tree under `js`

```
$ cd path/to/gnome-shell-43.4/js/ui
$ rg getInputSourceManager
status/keyboard.js
793:function getInputSourceManager() {
864:        this._inputSourceManager = getInputSourceManager();

keyboard.js
202:        let inputSourceManager = InputSourceManager.getInputSourceManager();
2172:        this._inputSourceManager = InputSourceManager.getInputSourceManager();
2240:            const inputSourceManager = InputSourceManager.getInputSourceManager();
```

Checking code around these lines for both versions used in bookworm (2023) and buster (2021), I don't see much changes.


## Testing under "Looking Glass"

Looking Glass is GNOME Shell's integrated debugger and inspector tool.  It's basic usage goes:

- Open with `Alt-F2`
- Enter `lg` to "Run a Command" prompt to start "Looking Glass"
- Enter a command e.g. `global.get_window_actors()` to the "Looking Glass" prompt
- Enter `Esc` to leave "Looking Glass"

I tested the following javascript snippet and its variants from "Looking Glass" prompt.

```
imports.ui.status.keyboard.getInputSourceManager().inputSources[0].activate()
```

This switched Input method to the first one.  Using `inputSources[1]` instead swiched Input method to the second one.  So this javascript code itself is still valid one.

So, problem is not javascript but its call via `gdbus` executed on the bash prompt.

```
$ gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/Shell --method org.gnome.Shell.Eval "imports.ui.status.keyboard.getInputSourceManager().inputSources[0].activate()"
(false, '')
```

This **false** looks suspicious.

Let me check if this calling was syntax correct by introspection:

```
$ gdbus introspect --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/Shell
node /org/gnome/Shell {
  ...
  interface org.gnome.Shell {
    methods:
      Eval(in  s script,
           out b success,
           out s result);
      ...
  };
  ...
};
```

So the calling syntax looks OK.

## gdbus error

Searching on "gdbus error" within 1 year lead me to the following articles.

- [dbus calls to gnome shell don't work under Ubuntu 22.04](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1412130/dbus-calls-to-gnome-shell-dont-work-under-ubuntu-22-04) -- 2022
- commit: [shellDBus: Restrict callers](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/commit/a628bbc4) -- 2022
- [Unsafe Mode Menu](https://github.com/linushdot/unsafe-mode-menu) -- Simple GNOME extension to change the Gnome Shell unsafe-mode via the quick settings menu/panel menu.

It looks like now shellDBus restricts callers to block `gdbus` calls.

I decided to install [Unsafe Mode Menu](https://github.com/linushdot/unsafe-mode-menu) and it worked!

For now, this is good enough.
