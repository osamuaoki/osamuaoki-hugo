## C Language

Except for some functional languages such as
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), many
procedual languages share quite a bit of similarities.
[C language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) is a good
start in terms of its gramatical simplicity.

Program control sequence keywords

|C syntax	|meaning |
| --- | --- |
|`expression;`	| simple expression statement 	 |
|`{statement...}`	| block statement 	 |
|`if (expression) statement`	| conditional execution	 |
|`if (expression) statement else statement`	| conditional executions	 |
|`switch (expression) {case const-express: {statement... break;}... default: statement}`	| conditional branch execution	 |
|`while (expression) statement`	| conditional loop execution	 |
|`do statement while (expression);`	| conditional loop execution	 |
|`for (i = 0; i++; i < n) statement`	| conditional loop execution i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1	 |
|`return expression;`	| return by exiting function	 |
|`continue;`	| continue to the next loop execution	 |
|`break;`	| break out of the loop/switch execution	 |
|`goto identifier`	| goto identifier label in the current function	 |

Type, structure, union, storage class declarations

|C declaration	|meaning |
| --- |--- |
|`void`	|pointer type	 |
|`char`	|byte type	 |
|`int`	|integer type	 |
|`float`	|single-precision floating point type	 |
|`double`	|double-precision floating point type	 |
|`enum`	|enumeration constant type	 |
|`short`	|type qualifier	 |
|`long`	|type qualifier	 |
|`signed`	|type qualifier	 |
|`unsigned`	|type qualifier	 |
|`const`	|type qualifier	 |
|`volatile`	|type qualifier	 |

### Unary operators

|C operator	|meaning |
| --- | --- |
|`-`	|arith.	minus |
|`~`	|bitwise not	 |
|`++`	|increment.	 |
|`--`	|decrement.	 |
|`sizeof`	|object size |
|`(typename)`	|type conversion |
|`*`	|reference (pointer, indirection) |
|`&`	|dereference (pointer, address of) |

### Binary operators

|C operator	|meaning |
| --- | --- |
|`+`	|arith. addition	 |
|`-`	|arith.	substraction |
|`*`	|arith.	multiplication |
|`/`	|arith.	division |
|`%`	|arith.	modulo |
|`&`	|bitwise and	 |
|`\|`	|bitwise or	 |
|`^`	|bitwise xor	 |
|`<<`	|bitwise shiftL	 |
|`>>`	|bitwise shiftR	 |
|`==`	|equal. test.	 |
|`!=`	|non-equal. test.	 |
|`<`	|less than	 |
|`<=`	|less or equal.	 |
|`>`	|more than	 |
|`>=`	|more or equal.	 |
|`!`	|bool. not	 |
|`&&`	|bool. and	 |
|`\|\|`	|bool. or	 |
|`=`	|assign.	 |
|`+=`	|aug. assign. with arith. addition	 |
|`-=`	|aug. assign. with arith. substraction |
|`*=`	|aug. assign. with arith. multiplication |
|`/=`	|aug. assign. with arith. division |
|`%=`	|aug. assign. with arith. modulo |
|`&=`	|aug. assign. with bitwise and |
|`\|=`	|aug. assign. with bitwise or |
|`^=`	|aug. assign. with bitwise xor |
|`<<=`	|aug. assign. with bitwise shiftL |
|`>>=`	|aug. assign. with bitwise shiftR |
|`.`	|member select. (structure) |
|`->`	|member select. (structure, pointed by parent)	 |
|`,`	|sequencing |

### Ternary and other operators

|C operator	|meaning |
| --- | --- |
|`? :`	|cond. eval.	 |
|`()`	|subexpression grouping	 |
|`()`	|calling function argument |
|`[]`	|array subscript |

Despite its simplicity, writing good code under C is not easy. If you write C
code carelessly with fixed width character array buffers, you are sure to hit a
buffer overflow bug which is serious bug. Memory management to cope with
variable length character array buffers under C is non-trivial task.

### Operator Precedence

| operator type | operator expression | precidence | space |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| func. operator, array operator, structure member operator | `func(...)` `array[...]` `parentptr->id` `parent.id` | L <- R | no |
| prefix unary operator (address-of, pointer-to, plus, minus, bitwise not, logical not) | `&` `*` `+` `-` `~` `!` | L <- R | no (yes before) |
| binary operator (mul., div., mod.) | `*` `/` `%` | L -> R | yes |
| binary operator (add, sub) | `+` `-` | L -> R | yes |
| bitwise shift operator (shr, shl) | `>>` `<<`| L -> R | yes |
| logical relational operator (gt,lt,ge,le) | `>` `<` `>=` `<=`| L -> R | yes |
| logical equity operator (eq,ne) | `==` `!=`| L -> R | yes |
| bitwise and operator (and) | `&` | L -> R | yes |
| bitwise xor operator (xor) | `^` | L -> R | yes |
| bitwise or operator (or) | `\|` | L -> R | yes |
| logical and operator (and) | `&&` | L -> R | yes |
| logical or operator (or) | `\|\|` | L -> R | yes |
| conditional operator | `? :` | L <- R | yes |
| assignment operator | `=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `+=` `-=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` `^=` `\|=` | L <- R | yes |
| comma operator | `,` | L -> R | no (yes for after) |

Please note:

* logical xor operator can be "`!a != !b`"
* "`foo = *p++`" is "`foo = *(p++)`" or "`foo = *p, p++`". (FIXME TEST!)
* "`int *foo()`" is a function "`foo`". The function returns a pointer to an integer value.  Equivalent of "`int *(foo())`".
* "`int (*foo)()`" is a function "(*foo)" pointed by "`foo`".  The function returns an integer value.
