Here is a series of memos of me trying to use ansible on Debian 12 (`bookworm`).

## Searching roles in Ansible Galaxy and `ansible-galaxy`

[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/) is a curation site for Ansible
roles and help us to find a useful roles.  The role data is fetched from github
repository.


## Creating full project template with `ansible-config` and `ansible-galaxy`

## Ansible roles and tags

Writing one big playbook in the base directory is messy.

The [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html) can be organized using:

- [Blocks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_blocks.html) -- logical groups of tasks
- [Roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) -- let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure.
- [Tags](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html) -- let you execute or skip selected tasks


Using these, the [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html) can be split into 4 types of independent files:

- variables files
- task files
- playbooks files
- roles files

"[Creating reusable files and roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse.html)" explains how to use these.
