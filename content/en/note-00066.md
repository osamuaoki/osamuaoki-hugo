Here is a series of memos of me trying to use ansible on Debian 12 (`bookworm`).

## Searching roles in Ansible Galaxy and `ansible-galaxy`

[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/) is a curation site for Ansible
scripts.  They are offered in 2 formats:

* [Roles](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/) -- data downloaded as "`git clone ...`".
* [Collections](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/collections/) -- data downloaded in "`*.tar.gz`" format.

Once some interesting script is found from the search on the
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/) web site, execute the listed
command.  E.g.:

```console
 $ ansible-galaxy ansible-galaxy role install foo.bar
 ...
```

Actual data seems to be coming from github.repository and is downloaded to
the default location `ANSIBLE_HOME` which is `~/.ansible`.

The default search path for the role can be found in the default `ansible.cfg`
template as:

```
# (pathspec) Colon separated paths in which Ansible will search for Roles.
roles_path={{ ANSIBLE_HOME ~ "/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles" }}
```

This "~" (tilde) operator is a [jinja string concatenation
operator](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#other-operators).

These scripts tend to address generic administration tasks on remote hosts and a bit
complicated.  Also, some of them are old and uses deprecated features.
Let me use them carefully only as reference examples to learn Ansible.

## Creating an initial system setup playbook

Let me expand the
"[Playbook to install multiple packages (use roles)]({{< ref "note-00065.md" >}}/#playbook-to-install-multiple-packages-use-roles)"
example to create an initial system setup playbook.
.

### Creating a full project template with `ansible-galaxy`

Let me create a full project template with `ansible-galaxy` as:

```console
 $ cd /path/to/ansible-config-data/
 $ cat >ansible.cfg << EOF
[defaults]
# (pathlist) Comma separated list of Ansible inventory sources
inventory=inventory.yml
# disables searching roles in ~/.ansible/roles
roles_path=./roles
EOF
 $ cat >inventory.yml << EOF
---
all:
  hosts:
    localhost:
      ansible_connection: local
EOF
 $ ansible-galaxy init roles/base
```

This creates a nice source template.  Let me merge what was presented in 
"[Playbook to install multiple packages (use roles)]({{< ref "note-00065.md" >}}/#playbook-to-install-multiple-packages-use-roles)"
to this template.

```
 $ tree
.
├── README.md
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory.yml
├── pb_main.yml
└── roles
    └── base
        ├── README.md
        ├── defaults
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── files
        ├── handlers
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── meta
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── tasks
        │   ├── install.yml
        │   ├── main.yml
        │   ├── remove.yml
        │   └── upgrade.yml
        ├── templates
        ├── tests
        │   ├── inventory
        │   └── test.yml
        └── vars
            └── main.yml
```

There are

* good old keys:`tasks`, `vars`
* some new keys: `defaults`, `handlers`, and `meta`
* some data file paths: `files`, `templates`
* test project path: `tests`

### Module to setup APT repository configuration

Let me setup APT repository using deb822 format  using following modules:

* [ansible.builtin.file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html) -- remove file
* [ansible.builtin.deb822_repository](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/deb822_repository_module.html)

`roles/base/tasks/apt_setup.yml`:
```
---
- name: Remove /etc/apt/sources.list
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /etc/apt/sources.list
    state: absent

- name: Set APT repository (debian)
  ansible.builtin.deb822_repository:
    name: debian
    types:
      - deb
      - deb-src
    uris: http://deb.debian.org/debian
    suites:
      - bookworm
      - bookworm-updates
      - bookworm-backports
    components:
      - main
      - non-free-firmware
      - contrib
      - non-free

- name: Set APT repository (debian-security)
  ansible.builtin.deb822_repository:
    name: debian-security
    types:
      - deb
      - deb-src
    uris: https://security.debian.org/debian-security/
    suites:
      - bookworm-security
    components:
      - main
      - non-free-firmware
      - contrib
      - non-free
```

[ansible.builtin.file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html)
can also be used to create files and directories and to set permissions on them.

### Module to copy configuration file

Let me setup `/etc/sudoers.d/passwordless` configuration file using following module:

* [ansible.builtin.copy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html)

`roles/base/tasks/sudoers.yml`:
```
- name: Allow passwordless for all %sudo
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: etc/sudoers.d/passwordless
    dest: /etc/sudoers.d/passwordless
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0644'
  tags:
    - sudoers

```

`roles/base/files/etc/sudoers.d/passwordless`:
```
# No passowrd required for the user in sudo group
# please note the last match wins configuration
%sudo ALL = (ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
# No password for 8 hours
#Defaults timestamp_timeout = 480
#Defaults timestamp_type = global
```

Here, a file specified by the relative path from `roles/base/files` is copied
to the remote system.

### Module to setup configuration file from a template file

Similar to `ansible.builtin.copy` module, `ansible.builtin.template` module can
setup using
[jinja template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine))
files specified by the relative paths from `roles/base/templates`.

* [ansible.builtin.template](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/template_module.html)

The template file uses `.j2` filename extension as a convention.  This helps
`vim` to apply the jinja syntax highlight.

### Modules to execute the shell command

Although using proper builtin modules is desirable in many cases, executing
an arbitrary program can be quite handy.

There are 4 modules to accommodate this.

* Python on the remote system is **required**:
  * [ansible.builtin.command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/command_module.html) -- No piping and redirects (C 2016)
  * [ansible.builtin.shell](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html)  -- Piping and redirects allowed (C 2018)
* Python on the remote system is **NOT required**:
  * [ansible.builtin.raw](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/raw_module.html) -- SSH command execution (C 2012)
  * [ansible.builtin.script](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/script_module.html) -- Copy script and execute (C 2012)


### Further actions

We can find more `ansible.builtin` modules at
[Ansible.Builtin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/).

As for the organization of the playbook, 
[blocks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_blocks.html)
can be used to make logical groups of tasks.

As for running some operations on change due to tasks,
[handler](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_handlers.html)
can be used.

I think I now grok how I can use Ansible.  So much for talking ....

I may need to change role name from generic word "base" to something more
specific when I code more practical playbooks.
