## GtkListBox and GtkFlowBox

* [GtkListBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ListBox.html) under the "Containers" button
* [GtkFlowBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/FlowBox.html) under the "Containers" button

These are like __Gtk.Box__ and __Gtk.Grid__ but its contents can by dynamically
sorted and filtered.

The children of these are __Gtk.ListBoxRow__ and __Gtk.FlowBoxChild__
respectively and these can be fairly complex. If the content of these are
simple enough, use of __Gtk.TreeView__ and __Gtk.IconView__ may save your
efforts.

## GtkTreeView

Although __Gtk.TreeView__ was mentioned as a simpler tool to use than
__Gtk.ListBox__, it is still quite complex since this involves
[Model-View type GUI conventions.](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/model-view-controller.py.html.en).
Let's use this with __Gtk.Template__ and Glade to learn how
it works.

NOTE: Please don't consider things described here and subsequent pages are the
best known methods.  I am merely recording how I got it work (sort of ...).

[GtkTreeView](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/TreeView.html)
is used with __Gtk.TreeModel__ such as
[GtkListStore](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ListStore.html)
or
[GtkTreeStore](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/TreeStore.html).

I wasn't clear what is the difference between these __GtkListStore__ and
__GtkTreeStore__ and; what is "view".
[Python (GTK) : Can someone explain the difference between TreeStore, Listmodel and all the rest?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28448852/python-gtk-can-someone-explain-the-difference-between-treestore-listmodel-a)
was a good one.  Then I found
[The Model/View/Controller design](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/model-view-controller.py.html.en)
which gave me some general idea.

For this let's create a `phone-book.py`/`phone-book.ui` example.  It took me a
while to make this working since existing examples usually don't use Glade nor
  __Gtk.Template__.

You place
[GtkTreeView](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/TreeView.html)
under the "Display" button to the desired window box.  Then click on pen-icon
in the "TreeView Model:" entry on the right side panel, and select "New" in the pop-up window.  This
will fill "TreeView Model:" entry box with "liststore1".

Then you select newly created "liststore1" object on the left side panel.
You can set types of data for each column and initial data to be filled-in.
Since column header is represented as comment in XML, these seems to be just
placeholders.

The rest of operations are pretty much routines.

## Example: GtkTreeView (Phone book)

Now we are ready to use this Glade origin header bar widget from `simple3.py`
by `header = Gtk.Template.Child()`:

{{< snippet "examples/glade/phone-book.py" >}}

Running this with `python3 phone-book.py` will start the GUI as:

![Run simple3](/img/phone-book-py.png)

Please play with this GUI to see label get updated as you select listed item..

## How Glade generated XML looks

Just in case I forget which items were selected via Glade session, here is the
Glade generated XML `simple3.ui`:

For adding capability to sort by column and filter, you can follow
