Let me keep up note on configuring and administrating my ThinkPad T14 Gen 1
(AMD) under Debian GNU/Linux.  My system has 2 NVMe SSDs:

* AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 PRO 4650U -- 6 cores, 12 threads
* 32GB (PC4-25600 DDR4 SDRAM) -- after adding aftermarket 16GB SDRAM
* WDC PC SN520 SDAPMUW-128G-1001 (20370001) -- Original Western Digital 128GB SSD
* TS2TMTE220S (42B8T4EA) -- Aftermarket Transcend 2TB SSD

## Adding 2TB SSD (2280 both side)

The original Western Digital 128GB PCIe SSD (2242, IC on top side only) is
removed and moved with thermal pad to the unused PCIe slot intended for WAN
card.

The aftermarket Transcend 2TB PCIe SSD (2280, IC on top and bottom sides) is
installed to the original SSD slot.

## Distribution selection

In order to have decent graphics support easily, current testing distribution
(bullseye) is used.

```
$ uname -a
Linux goofy 5.9.0-5-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.9.15-1 (2020-12-17) x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Non-free firmwares

I think we need some non-free drivers.

* `firmware-amd-graphics`  --- GPU
* `firmware-iwlwifi`  --- WIFI ?
* `firmware-misc-nonfree`  --- ?
* `firmware-realtek`  --- NIC ?
* `amd64-microcode`  --- CPU

## EFI-based firmware updates

Install `gnome-firmware` package and update firmware on devices supported by
`fwupd` via GUI.

## Network configuration

Since there are 2 Ethernet devices (one on right side and one accessible from
docking station), I updated `/etc/network/interfaces` as follows to make them
hot-pluggable.

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# GNOME
### The network interface on normal port
allow-hotplug enp2s0
# This is an autoconfigured IPv4 interface
iface enp2s0 inet dhcp
# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface
iface enp2s0 inet6 auto

### The network interface on extra port
allow-hotplug enp2s0f0
# This is an autoconfigured IPv4 interface
iface enp2s0f0 inet dhcp
# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface
iface enp2s0f0 inet6 auto
```

## Audio configuration

REFERENCE: https://yoshimemo.com/post-889/

### Workaround (rev. 1: manual)

For the regression of missing analog audio output incident experienced from
late-2020 (now 2021-Jan), my workaround is to run the following from console
after installing `pulseaudio-utils` once for every booting manually:

```
 $ pactl load-module module-detect
```

### Workaround (rev. 2: automatic)

Although modifying a distribution provided file as workaround is not my
favorite move, I did it anyway to make this workarund automatic.

Modify `/etc/pulse/default.pa` as follows:

```
$ cd /etc/pulse/
$ diff -u default.pa.orig  default.pa
--- default.pa.orig	2020-02-06 11:06:41.000000000 +0900
+++ default.pa	2021-01-08 11:15:09.001167903 +0900

### Adjusting sound level

Use `alsamixer` to set proper volume:
 * `F6` -> `1  HD-Audio Generic` -> `Master` -> Up-arrows to 100

## LibreOffice

The version of LibreOffice available on Debian testing environment has some
glitches more often than the version available on Debian stable environment.
Issues for printing to Hagaki was the killer bug for me.

I find that the installation of [LibreOffice Debian
packages](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/?type=deb-x86_64&lang=en)
available from [the upstream LibreOffice site](https://www.libreoffice.org/) on
Debian testing environment is the least effort solution for me.  For stability,
I chose older stable 6.4.7.2-2 version aimed for business deployments (2021/12).
This enabled me to print nicely to Hagaki.
