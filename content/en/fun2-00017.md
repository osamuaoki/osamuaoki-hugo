## GTK+ GUI programs

Here are some pointers to example codes for GNOME GUI:

* [Beginner Gtk+ Course](https://live.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/Tasks/DeveloperDocs/BeginnerTutorials) (August 20, 2012)
* [GNOME Developer Platform Demos](http://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/) (These are mostly empty templates as of 2012.)

Let me record my practice codes which create executables with the following
same behaviour.

First it displays a small window as:

```
 +----------------X
 |    Click me!   |
 |                |
 +----------------+
```

If you click it with the mouse pointer, it updates its display via call
backfunction mechanism.  For example, after 3 clicks, it displays a small
window as:

```
 +--------------------X
 |   Hello World!     |
 |   Click count = 3  |
 +--------------------+
```

If you click the right top corner of window, this window is closed and program
is terminated.

My first set of example codes do not use Glade while my second set of example
codes use Glade for defining GUI design.

### C

Let's try to use the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries to build GUI version of a
"Hello World!" program in simple C.

Source code: gui.c


{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3/gui.c" >}}


Let's look for the right compile and link options for the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries.

Search the development package of gtk+3.0

{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3/gtk3-apt.log" >}}


If the `libgtk-3-dev` package has not been installed, install it now.

Search the right `*.pc` file for gtk+3.0 for use with `pkg-config`.

Search the right *.pc file for gtk+3.0

{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3/gtk3-dpkg.log" >}}


Now you can obtain the right compile and link options used by gtk+3.0.

Compile and link options used by gtk+3.0

{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3/gtk3-pkg-config.log" >}}


Let's compile `gui.c` program with gtk+3.0.

Compilation of gui.c into the gtk+3.0 GUI program gui.

{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3/gui.log" >}}


Let's list linked libraries to the ELF object hello with the `nm` command.
..  Impressive ... or too much.

### Python

Let's try to use the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries to build GUI version of a "Hello
World!" program with simple Python.

Source code `gui` in Python language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/python/gui" >}}


Please note, "`from gi.repository import Gtk`" at the top.

### Vala

Let's try to use the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries to build GUI version of a "Hello
World!" program with simple Vala.  Just like the Vala examples for "CLI
programs", we present codes in 3 different styles.

#### Simple non-OOP style (no class)

Source code `gui-1.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-1.vala" >}}


Let's compile `gui-1.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-1`.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-1.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-1c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.

One notable logical difference from the corresponding C program example is the
use of dynamically assigned object pointed by `Block1Data* _data1_` and maneged
by reference counting.

Since no OOP techniques are used, the resulting C code does not have GObject
related macros.

#### OOP style (main outside of class)

Source code `gui-2.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-2.vala" >}}


TIP: The above example skips specifying `GLib` for the parent class since it is
the default for Vala.

Let's compile `gui-2.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-2` and run it.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-2.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-2c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.
The Vala compiler took care chores of generating CPP macros for GObject
with.

* No prefix.
* `gui`, `GUI`, `Gui`: object type (= class) name
* `gui_get_type()`: returning GType of object GUI

#### OOP style (main inside of class)

Source code `gui-3.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-3.vala" >}}


TIP: The above example skips specifying `GLib` for the parent class since it is
the default for Vala.

Let's compile `gui-3.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-3` and run it.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-3.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala/gui-3c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.
The Vala compiler took care chores of generating CPP macros for GObject
with.

* No prefix.
* `gui`, `GUI`, `Gui`: object type (= class) name
* `gui_get_type()`: returning GType of object GUI

### Glade

Let's try to design GUI for a "Hello World!" with Glade and try to be used by
the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries.  For most cases, we should create `clickme.glade`.

GUI design XML file `clickme.glade` generated by Glade.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/glade/clickme.glade" >}}


TIP: You can check this by "`glade clickme.glade`".

For Vala, the Gtk.Builder's signal auto-connection mechanism uses the C name.
The CamelCase namespace and class name prefix for the callback method name is
converted to the lower_case C name prefix.

So for such cases as described later, we create `clickme-ext.glade`, instead.

Alternative GUI design XML file `clickme-ext.glade` generated by Glade.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/glade/clickme-ext.glade" >}}


TIP: The class name prefix "`HelloWorld.`" is converted to the C name prefix
"`hello_world_`" in the Glade XML file used by the Gtk.Builder.

### C with Glade

Let's try to use the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries and Glade generated XML file to
build GUI version of a "Hello World!" program in C.

Source code: gui.c


{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3-glade/gui.c" >}}


Let's compile `gui.c` program with gtk+3.0.

Compilation of gui.c into the gtk+3.0 GUI program gui.

{{< snippet "examples/gui/gtk3-glade/gui.log" >}}


Let's list linked libraries to the ELF object hello with the `nm` command.
..  Impressive ... or too much.

### Python with Glade

Let's try to use the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries to build GUI program with Python.

Source code `gui` in Python language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/python-glade/gui" >}}


TIP: The content of the "`class Handler:`" class provides the callback handlers.

### Vala with Glade

Let's try to use the gtk+3.0 GUI libraries to build GUI version of a "Hello
World!" program in Vala with the Glade generated GUI definition XML
configuration file.

TIP: You need to specify the additional gmodule module to the Vala compiler
option as "`--pkg gmodule-2.0`".  This enables the dynamic loading of methods
based on the glade XML data during the program execution.

#### Simple non-OOP style (no class)

Source code `gui-1.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-1.vala" >}}


Since no namespace nor class isused, simple "`clickme.glade`" is used here.

Let's compile `gui-1.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-1`.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-1.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-1c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.

One notable logical difference from the corresponding C program example is the
use of dynamically assigned object pointed by `Block1Data* _data1_` and maneged
by reference counting.

Since no OOP techniques are used, the resulting C code does not have GObject
related macros.

#### OOP style (main outside of class, callback as static)

Source code `gui-2.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-2.vala" >}}


Since class is isused, "`clickme-ext.glade`" is used here.

Although you see compiler warnings like "`warning: method ... never used`", do
not worry.  They are used via Gtk.Builder callback mechanism.

Let's compile `gui-2.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-2` and run it.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-2.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-2c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.
The Vala compiler took care chores of generating CPP macros for GObject
with.

* No prefix.
* `gui`, `GUI`, `Gui`: object type (= class) name
* `gui_get_type()`: returning GType of object GUI

#### OOP style (main outside of class, callback as instance)

Source code `gui-3.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-3.vala" >}}


Since class is isused, "`clickme-ext.glade`" is used here.

Although you see compiler warnings like "`warning: method ... never used`", do
not worry.  They are used via Gtk.Builder callback mechanism.

Please make sure to use "`[CCode (instance_pos = -1)]`" when using instance
methods instead of static methods as callback handlers for the Gtk.Builder's
signal auto-connection mechanism.

Let's compile `gui-3.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-3` and run it.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-3.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-3c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.
The Vala compiler took care chores of generating CPP macros for GObject
with.

* No prefix.
* `gui`, `GUI`, `Gui`: object type (= class) name
* `gui_get_type()`: returning GType of object GUI

#### OOP style (main inside of class, callback as static)

Source code `gui-4.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-4.vala" >}}


Since class is isused, "`clickme-ext.glade`" is used here.

Although you see compiler warnings like "`warning: method ... never used`", do
not worry.  They are used via Gtk.Builder callback mechanism.

Let's compile `gui-4.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-4` and run it.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-4.log" >}}


You can get the C source as:



{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-4c.log" >}}


It is obvious that the Vala code is much shorter than the generated C code.

with.

* No prefix.
* `gui`, `GUI`, `Gui`: object type (= class) name
* `gui_get_type()`: returning GType of object GUI

#### OOP style (main inside of class, callback as instance)

Source code `gui-5.vala` in Vala language


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-5.vala" >}}


Since class is isused, "`clickme-ext.glade`" is used here.

Although you see compiler warnings like "`warning: method ... never used`", do
not worry.  They are used via Gtk.Builder callback mechanism.

Please make sure to use "`[CCode (instance_pos = -1)]`" when using instance
methods instead of static methods as callback handlers for the Gtk.Builder's
signal auto-connection mechanism.

Let's compile `gui-5.vala` to create the ELF object `gui-5` and run it.


{{< snippet "examples/gui/vala-glade/gui-5.log" >}}
