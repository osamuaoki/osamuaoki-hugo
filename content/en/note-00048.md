Here is a memo to make a Linux system run and shutdown smoothly and quickly.

## Ruducing system loads

I have edited `Settings` -> `Search` menu to disable background jobs.

Currently, I disabled everything.  This seems to reduce CPU loads from the
following process names:

- `tracker-miner-fs-3` about 5-8%
- `tracker-extract-3` about 3-5%

## Quick workaround for timeout

- https://itsfoss.com/long-shutdown-linux/

Edit `/etc/systemd/system.conf` to reduce timeout from default 100s according to
`systemd-system.conf`(5):

```
 DefaultTimeoutStartSec=, DefaultTimeoutStopSec=,
 DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=, DefaultRestartSec=
     Configures the default timeouts for starting, stopping and aborting
     of units, as well as the default time to sleep between automatic
     restarts of units, as configured per-unit in TimeoutStartSec=,
     TimeoutStopSec=, TimeoutAbortSec= and RestartSec= (for services, see
     systemd.service(5) for details on the per-unit settings). Disabled
     by default, when service with Type=oneshot is used. For non-service
     units, DefaultTimeoutStartSec= sets the default TimeoutSec= value.
     DefaultTimeoutStartSec= and DefaultTimeoutStopSec= default to 90s.
     DefaultTimeoutAbortSec= is not set by default so that all units fall
     back to TimeoutStopSec=.  DefaultRestartSec= defaults to 100ms.
```

This can be a quick workaround to reduce time to shutdown from 100s to 60s
without knowing the offending process.

This is not the root cause fix.

## Root cause fix for timeout

- https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11821#issuecomment-477545885

Setting up proper shutdown sequence is the root cause fix.

<!--
XXX untested
You can find offending systemd service file by running the following shell
script:
```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
find /usr/lib/systemd/system/*.service -type f | \
xargs grep --files-with-matches DefaultDependencies=no | \
xargs grep --files-with-matches Conflicts=.*shutdown.target | \
xargs grep --files-without-match Before=.*shutdown.target
```
-->

For example, I edited the seemingly offending `*.service` files such as
`/lib/systemd/user/tracke~er-fs-control-3.service` by adding dependency as:
```
[Unit]
...
Conflicts=shutdown.target initrd-switch-root.target
Before=shutdown.target initrd-switch-root.target

[Service]
...
```

This seemed to help avoid waiting for timeout.
