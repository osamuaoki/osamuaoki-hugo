My objective here is to learn efficient GUI programming with Glade
and Python using Gtk.Builder class instead of calling widget classes directly
and using decorators offered by Gtk.Templates.

I only touch on essential concepts in the order of practical importance and
skip trivial points and points already addressed in
[The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## GTK GUI situation

GTK3 GUI has been changing.  (version 3.38.5, 2021-07, Debian Bullseye)

[The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/menus.html)
(as of 2021-07) goes as:

> Gtk.UIManager, Gtk.Action, and Gtk.ActionGroup have been deprecated since
> GTK+ version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code. Use the
> Application framework instead.

I understand this is caused by
[App Menu Retirement](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/wikis/App-Menu-Retirement).
I see no Python based tutorial contents for creating modern
[Primary menu](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/primary-menus.html.en)
on the headbar using the client side decoration (CSD).

How do I do it?  Unfortunately, many code examples in the upstream source tree
and the tutorial tend to contain old deprecated practices.  This is why I
recorded my learning experiences here.  (Actual my experiences were much more
twisted.  I have touched up my learning history to make it easy for me to
understand how to this again.)

## Gtk 3 documentation for Python user

As usual with F/LOSS documents, there are too many similar documents including
old ones out there.

These are the key documents:

* Reference documents:
    * [GTK+ 3 Reference Manual](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/)
      (web and devhelp)
        * This is written primarily for user writing code in C and uses C API
          names.
        * Help contents displayed by Glade is this document.
        * The one line descriptions of GTK+ Widgets names used in Glade are listed
          in its [TOC page of "Part II. GTK+ Widgets and Objects"](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtkobjects.html).
        * [Widget Gallery](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch03.html) is
          included.
    * [PyGObject API Reference: Gtk 3.0](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0)
      (web-only)
        * This is part of [PyGObject API Reference](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/)
          and uses Python API names.
        * For coding in Python, this gives exact class names.
* Tutorial and demo documents:
    * [The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        * Good source of many GTK3 widget examples with direct Python-only
          coding style.
        * Not much examples for use of Glade nor Gtk.Template technique.
    * [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        * [PyGObject: User Guide](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/)
            * [PyGObject: User Guide: Gtk.Template](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/gtk_template.html)
    * [Tutorials, code samples and platform demos in Python](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/py.html.en)
        * [GTK+ widgets sample code](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/beginner.py.html.en)
            * Learn basic [theory of GUI programming](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/beginner.py.html.en#theory)
              such as
              [The Model/View/Controller design](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/model-view-controller.py.html.en).
        * Some parts still mention PyGtk indicating lack of recent updates.  So
          be careful when reading.

Please note the GTK3's C API name is spelled __without__ "__.__" after
"__Gtk__", while the corresponding Python API name is spelled __with__ "__.__"
after "__Gtk__".

Once you understand this, C API document becomes useful for Python programmer.

(If you see Python GTK document with their first part of GTK class name
spelled in all lower case such as "__gtk.Window__" instead, you are reading old
API based documents such as
[PyGTK 2.0 Reference Manual](https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/).
Though they look similar, it is based on pre-GObject Introspection API and
they are old.  Keep away from them :-))

## GUI programming workflow

Let's recap my planned GUI programming workflow here.

* Design static GUI components with Glade
    * Set the "__composite__" checkbox for the ID of the top GUI widget to make it
      "Class name".
    * You don't need to worry too much on ID or call back function names.  Just
      settle with automatic ones and deal them in Python code.
* Program dynamic GUI components with Python
    * Use GObject Introspection to access GTK and associated libraries from
      simple Python code.
    * Use `Gtk.Template.Child()` to create variables matching IDs in Glade XML to access widgets.
      * `Gtk.Template` can handle unmatched variable and ID combination
        gracefully

Know some limitations for Glade:
* Glade can set only one top level widget as "__composit__"=ON per one Glade XML
  file.
  * Decorator `Gtk.Template` approach requires one Glade XML file for each top level widget.
  * "Transient for:" in Glade is non-compatible with decorator `Gtk.Template` approach.
* When using Glade to create GUI, you are using
  [Gtk.Buildable](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Buildable.html#Gtk.Buildable)
  to create GUI widgets.  So the "User data" parameter can take widgets defined in the Glade XML only.
  No external constant number nor string.
* Changing widget types or renaming IDs or shuffling position of widgets in Glade XML file are easier with the text editor than Glade.
* When Glade doesn't work as expected while leaving `<placeholder/>` in the XML
  file, use the text editor to fix it.
    * [Can't add GtkHeaderBar to window with existing widgets / containers](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade/-/issues/499)
    * Read the pertinent API document carefully around parts mentioning
      [Gtk.Buildable](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Buildable.html#Gtk.Buildable)
      and use them
    * Look for the successful XML file dealing the similar situation and
      imitate it.

## Glade

Let me go step-by-step to use Glade to create GTK GUI in my way.

In order to understand what each Glade widget does, the
[TOC page "Part II. GTK+ Widgets and Objects"](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtkobjects.html)
gives me the best one-line summary.

Please note Glade uses C API names.

For details on Python API, linked pages from the corresponding listed classes
in the Gtk 3.0's
[Classes](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes.html) page were
valuable and gave me the most current insights.

## Where to start GUI design

Looking at the way Glade is designed, it looked like I should start creating
window design by clicking and moving item from selection in the top 4 big
buttons to the center canvas.

Out of these 4 big buttons, the "Toplevels" button seems to be a good to start.
Let's check what are these GUI objects in "Toplevels".

* [Gtk.Window](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html#class-details) — Toplevel which can contain other widgets
* [Gtk.OffscreenWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/OffscreenWindow.html#class-details) — A toplevel to manage offscreen rendering of child widgets
* [Gtk.ApplicationWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/ApplicationWindow.html#class-details) — GtkWindow subclass with GtkApplication support
* [Gtk.Dialog](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Dialog.html#class-details) — Create popup windows
  * __Gtk....Dialog__  — Create specific purpose helper popup windows for typical use cases
* [Gtk.Assistant](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Assistant.html#class-details) — A widget used to guide users through multi-step operations 

Since I want a simple GUI,
[GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html)
seems to be a good starting point for the GUI programming learning experience for me now, though
[Gtk.ApplicationWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/ApplicationWindow.html#class-details)
seems to be a good starting point for serious applications in future

[Glade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glade_Interface_Designer)
generates
[GtkBuilder UI descriptions](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkBuilder.html#BUILDER-UI)
in a XML file and
[Gtk.Buildable](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Buildable.html#gtk-buildable-vfuncs)
consumes this XML file to create complicated widgets.
Please pay attention to some of these linked pages talking how widgets are implemented in the
[Gtk.Buildable](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Buildable.html#gtk-buildable-vfuncs).

How to create the top bar embedded primary menu is tricky with
[GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html).
It looks like
[GtkHeaderBar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/HeaderBar.html)
under the "Containers" button is the one to be used. We will get back to this
[header bar topic later](/en/2021/07/17/pygi-3/).

Please note
[GtkMenuBar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/MenuBar.html)
is not the one to be used for creating the menu (marked as deprecated for Glade
3.38.2).

## How to write a clean python code

Being a lazy person, I want to write a clean and easy python code using
[decorator](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/) technique as described
in
[The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial: 22.5.  Gtk.Template](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builder.html#gtk-template).
This is extremely terse.  The upstream document is found at
[PyGObject: Docs » User Guide » Gtk.Template](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/gtk_template.html)
gives a bit more details.
[PyGObject API Reference under Gtk 3.0 » Classes](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes.html)
has no mention of this __Gtk.Template__.

It's best to check how this __Gtk.Template__ is implemented to be confident.
This is found in the __python3-gi__ package as
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/_gtktemplate.py` imported from
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/overrides/Gtk.py`.  Reading these gives us
what exactly does this decorator does.

In order to use this decorator technique, the top level widget needs to be
declared as `<template>` instead of `<object>` in XML.  For Glade, this
requires us to click the "__Composite__" checkbox next to ID entry box on the
right side panel to change "__ID__" to "__Class Name__" while focusing at the
top level widget
[GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html) on
the left side panel for my simple example case here.

Let's put "simple1" to "ID"/"Class Name" entry and see the difference in
XML.
