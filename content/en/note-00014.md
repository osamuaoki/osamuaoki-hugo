My objective here is to establish efficient GUI programming example with Glade
and Python using Gtk.Builder class instead of calling widget classes directly.

I only touch on essential concepts in the order of practical importance and
skip trivial points and points already addressed in
[The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## GTK GUI situation

GTK3 GUI has been changing.  (version 3.38.5, 2021-07, Debian Bullseye)

[The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/menus.html)
(as of 2021-07) goes as:

> Gtk.UIManager, Gtk.Action, and Gtk.ActionGroup have been deprecated since
> GTK+ version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code. Use the
> Application framework instead.

I understand this is caused by
[App Menu Retirement](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/wikis/App-Menu-Retirement).
I see no Python based tutorial contents for creating modern
[Primary menu](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/primary-menus.html.en)
etc.  How do I do it?  Unfortunately, many code examples in the upstream source
tree and the tutorial tend to contain old deprecated practices.  This is why I
recorded my learning experiences here.

## Glade

Let me go step-by-step to use Glade to create GTK GUI in my way.

In order to understand what each Glade widget does, linked pages from the
corresponding listed classes in the Gtk 3.0's
[Classes](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes.html) page were
valuable and gave me the most current insights.  This is a part of
[PyGObject API Reference](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/).

[GTK+ 3 Reference Manual](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/) is the same
content as the system installed "GTK+3 Reference Manual" normally read using
the __devhelp__ package and is the C API Reference.

Each __Glade widget__ name in Glade widget dialogue is spelled __without__
"__.__", while the __Gtk class__ name used in the Python program is spelled
__with__ "__.__" after "__Gtk__".

This is because the help content by Glade uses the C API name while the Python
program uses PyGObject API.  From Python user point-of-view, this is a bit
confusing.  But we need to get used to correspondence between C API names and
Python API ones, since there are more information described with this C API
name,

(If you see Python GTK document with their first part of GTK class name
spelled in all lower case such as "__gtk.Window__" instead, you are reading old
API based documents such as
[PyGTK 2.0 Reference Manual](https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/).
Though they look similar, it is based on pre-GObject Introspection API and
they are old.  Keep away from them :-))

## Where to start GUI design

Looking at the way Glade is designed, it looked like I should start creating
window design by clicking and moving item from selection in the top 4 big
buttons to the center canvas.

Since I want a simple GUI,
[GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html)
found under the "Toplevels" button seems to be a good one as the starting
object.  (For other items under the "Toplevels" button, they seem to offer
mostly pop-up window dialogue etc.  One exception is
[GtkApplicationWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ApplicationWindow.html)
which accommodates additional capability to start program via DBus connection
over the simple
[GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html).

How to create the top bar embedded primary menu is tricky.  It looks like
[GtkHeaderBar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/HeaderBar.html)
under the "Containers" button is the one to be used. We will get back to this
[header bar topic later](/en/2021/07/17/pygi-3/).

Please note
[GtkMenuBar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/MenuBar.html)
is not the one to be used for creating the menu (marked as deprecated for Glade
3.38.2).

## How to write a clean python code

Being a lazy person, I want to write a clean and easy python code using
[decorator](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/) technique as described
in
[The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial: 22.5.  Gtk.Template](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builder.html#gtk-template).
This is extremely terse.  The upstream document is found at
[PyGObject: Docs » User Guide » Gtk.Template](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/gtk_template.html)
gives a bit more details.
[PyGObject API Reference under Gtk 3.0 » Classes](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes.html)
has no mention of this __Gtk.Template__.

It's best to check how this __Gtk.Template__ is implemented to be confident.
This is found in the __python3-gi__ package as
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/_gtktemplate.py` imported from
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/overrides/Gtk.py`.  Reading these gives us
what exactly does this decorator does.

In order to use this decorator technique, the top level widget needs to be
declared as `<template>` instead of `<object>` in XML.  For Glade, this
requires us to click the "composite" checkbox next to ID entry box on the right
side panel to change "ID" to "Class Name" while focusing at the top level
widget
[GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html) on
the left side panel for my simple example case here.

Let's put "simple1" to "ID"/"Class Name" entry and see the difference in
XML.
{{< snippet "examples/glade/simple1.ui.diff" >}}

## How to fill static simple widgets into GUI

Dividing area into smaller subdivided areas are mostly done by
[GtkBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Box.html)
or
[GtkGrid](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Grid.html)
under the "Containers" button.

As a starter, I put
[GtkBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Box.html).

Then I placed 2 simple "Control" widgets and a simple __GtkLabel__
"Display" widget as an easy starter:
* [GtkButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Button.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkEntry](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Entry.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkLabel](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Label.html) under the "Display" button

I set IDs for these widgets basically by dropping "Gtk" from the GTk class
names.  Then set up signal handlers in the right panel.

| ID/Class name     | Widget               | Signal            | Signal handler  |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| simple1           | GtkWindow            | destroy           | onDestroy       |
| button            | GtkButton            | pressed           | onButtonPressed |
| entry             | GtkEntry             | changed           | onEntryChanged  |
| label             | GtkLabel             | ---               |  ---              |

Then Glade screen looks like:

## How to create a simple GUI program

Now we are ready to use this from `simple1.py`:

{{< snippet "examples/glade/simple1.py" >}}

The meaning of "@..." is described in [Decorator in PEP 318](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/).

Running this with `python3 simple1.py` will start the GUI as:

![Run simple1](/img/simple1-py.png)

Please play with this GUI while looking at your terminal outputs.

Here, I am using the signal handler which uses the call back functions which set
class variables in this example code.  Now the rationale to use the class which
generates functions and associated data is clear to me.  It is a good start but
this is not sufficient experience to make useful GUI since we still lack
examples to use "Control" and "Display" widgets.

## How Glade generated XML looks

Just in case I forget which items were selected via Glade session, here is the
Glade generated XML `simple1.ui`:
