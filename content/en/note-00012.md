## Development system infrastructure

In order to keep development setups to be simple and robust for both package
build and package test, I decided to set up KVM.  (I was suffering sudden
cowbuilder failure. That was another motivation.)

Planned infrastructure includes:

* APT proxy on host WS.
* Avahi mDNS environment with domain nane "local"
* VM as KVM for package build. (non-GUI)
* VM as KVM for package testing. (GUI)
* SSH connection among systems.
* Mini private APT repo to satisfy dependency as needed.

## APT proxy on host WS

In order to save network traffic, I decided to set up APT proxy on host WS.

There are 4 good candidates.
* [apt-cacher](https://salsa.debian.org/LeePen/apt-cacher): This needs to be installed with the web server.  Older code in perl (but it was newer than apt-.  Getting replaced by apt-cacher-ng.
* [apt-cacher-ng](https://salsa.debian.org/blade/apt-cacher-ng/-/tree/debian/sid): Newer and well maintained code in C++.
  * This package is [the most popular package](https://qa.debian.org/popcon-graph.php?packages=apt-cacher+apt-cacher-ng+approx+squid-deb-proxy&show_installed=on&want_legend=on&want_ticks=on&from_date=&to_date=&hlght_date=&date_fmt=%25Y-%25m&beenhere=1).
  * This package had [some problem in 2010](https://wiki.debian.org/Simple-CDD/Howto?action=diff&rev1=51&rev2=50).
* [approx](https://salsa.debian.org/ocaml-team/approx): Less docs but its simplicity seems to make it more robust.
* [squid-deb-proxy](https://launchpad.net/squid-deb-proxy): This needs generic proxy server (No way to read cached package data)

It looks like `apt-cacher-ng` is the one for me to use.

* Execute: `apt install apt-cacher-ng`
* "Set up once" -> "keep"... -> "Allow HTTP tunnels...": Yes

Currently, I experienced funny [bug#986356](https://bugs.debian.org/986356).
You may need to run script I posted there.

### Set up proxy for the local APT

There are 2 interesting packages.

* auto-apt-proxy -- no mDNS compatible --  https://salsa.debian.org/debian/auto-apt-proxy
* squid-deb-proxy-client -- mDNS compatible -- https://launchpad.net/squid-deb-proxy

WARN: Installing `auto-apt-proxy` package without functioning proxy may cause
problem.

For my purpose, proxy is always the local for host WS or the gateway WS(=host
WS) for VMs.  Simply installing `auto-apt-proxy` is suffice to set up APT
proxy.

## Install VM infrastructure

* Execute: `apt install virt-manager qemu-kvm`
* Read /usr/share/doc/libvirt-daemon/README.Debian.gz and follow it.

```
$ sudo bash
# virsh net-start default
# virsh net-autostart default
# mkdir /etc/dnsmasq.d
# cat <<EOF >/etc/dnsmasq.d/00_libvirtd.conf
# only bind to loopback by default
interface=lo
bind-interfaces
EOF
# ^D
```

### Create minimal stable VM

* Download the ISO for Debian stable. (netinst: 337MiB)
* Start virt-manager
* Create a new virtual machine from Debian stable ISO without Desktop (Use
  en_US).
  * Name as "debian10" (automtic)
  * Format: qcow2
  * Capacity: 20GiB
  * Mostly go with defaults
  * Activate virtual network
  * Guided - use entire disk
  * Write disk - Yes
  * Unset "Debian desktop environment" and "print server", and set "SSH server"
  * GRUB install to MBR: Yes, `/dev/vda`
  * Installation complete and GRUB screen -> VM started
  * Shutdown VM
  * Clone from "debian10" to "buster-mini"
  * Start "buster-mini" and login to "root"
    * `apt-get update&& apt-get install vim nano- aptitude screen gpm avahi-utils`
      * Installation of `gpm` package allows me to see mouse pointer on the
        Linux console.  This makes it easier to get out of fullscreen mode by
        moving mouse cursor to the top center. (Some times it moves strangely
        but OK for this purpose.)
      * Installation of `avahi-utils` allows easy access to local hosts.
  * Shutdown "buster-mini" with `shutdown -h now`.

### Creating GNOME VM

  * Clone from "buster-mini" to "buster-GNOME"
  * Start "buster-GNOME" and login to "root"
    * `apt-get update&& apt-get install task-gnome-desktop`
  * If you get errors from aptitude, go to host and fix apt-cacher-ng
    repository and than try again.  (Don't use `--fix-missing`)
  * Rebooting VM got me to nice GNOME system up.

### Creating sid VM for development

  * Clone from "debian10" to "sid-dev"
  * Change `/etc/apt/sources.list`

```
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ sid main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ sid main
```

  * `apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade && apt autoremove`
  * `apt-get install devscripts`

## VM house keepings


### Changing hostname

To change hostname of the VM permanently, you need to edit `/etc/hostname` and
`/etc/hosts` and reboot the VM.  (The hostname of running system can be set to
"<newhostname>" just as `hostname <newhostname>` but updates of mDNS record
seen from other VMs and the host WS need reboot of the VM.)

### Setting up SSH

As long as the host WS and guest VMs are installed with `avahi-utils`, we can
use each host name appended with "`.local`" to access using good old SSH.  For
example between VMs.

```
osamu@sid-dev:~$ ssh sid-GNOME.local
```

SSH login directly to root account of a system are probably blocked.  In that
case, you must SSH into user account first and sudo/su to root.

Use of SSH key placed in user's home directory is a good idea.  Typical key
generation goes:

```
osamu@sid-dev:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

### Setting up `sudo`

Following will configure `sudo` to allow user "osamu" for root privilege.

```
 $ su
Password:
root@sid-dev:/home/osamu# /sbin/adduser osamu sudo
...
root@sid-dev:/home/osamu# echo >/etc/sudoers.d/sudo-group <<EOF
# NO password for the primary user
%sudo ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
EOF
```

### VM tools

I am not familiar with VM oriented tools yet.  Following packages seem
something to learn.

* https://libvirt.org/ supporting EMU, KVM, XEN, OpenVZ, LXC, and
  VirtualBox.
  * `libvirt-clients` (`virsh` command etc.)
  * `virt-manager`: desktop application
  * `virtinst`: CLI equiv of `virt-manage`
  * `libvirt-login-shell`: isolate user sessions using LXC container
*  http://libguestfs.org [FAQ](https://libguestfs.org/guestfs-faq.1.html)
  * `libguestfs-tools`: guest disk image management system

## Local repo

After reading https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Setup checking their
[popularity](https://qa.debian.org/popcon-graph.php?packages=reprepro+mini-dinstall+debarchiver+apt-ftparchive+aptly&show_installed=on&want_legend=on&want_ticks=on&from_date=&to_date=&hlght_date=&date_fmt=%25Y-%25m&beenhere=1),
I decided to go with `reprepro` package by following a [tutorial](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/SetupWithReprepro) later.

## Helper script

I created short scripts and use them to initialize Debian VMs.  This also takes
care SSH keys: https://github.com/osamuaoki/vm-setup
