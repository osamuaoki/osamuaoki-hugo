## Workstation usability

Let me keep up note on configuring and administrating my workstation under
Debian Buster (10) GNU/Linux. This is non-hardware specific tips.

### EFI-based firmware updates

Install `gnome-firmware` package and invoke GUI to update firmware on devices
supported by `fwupd` using [Linux Vendor Firmware Service](https://fwupd.org/).

Thinkpad EFI firmware and SSD firmware were updated.

### GUI Desktop customization

Install `gnome-tweak` package to the system and tweaked to add "Applications"
to top bar etc.

After installing
[GNOME Shell integration](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep)
to the Chrome browser, I installed following extensions:
* [Hide Activities Button](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/744/hide-activities-button/)

Adjust locally installed GNOME extensions via browser from [GNOME Extension web
site](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/).

### Keyboard shortcut customization (GNOME Settings)

For selecting IM deterministically (instead of Super-SPACE toggle), bind
javascript MACRO to keys by `Keyboard Shortcuts`.

* SUPER-Enter: English
* SUPER-J: Anthy
* SUPER-K: Mozc

See [Japanese input on US-keyboard (in Japanese)](https://osamuaoki.github.io/jp/2019/03/23/gnome-uskb-im-select/)

### Keyboard shortcut customization (GNOME Tweaks)

For Vim use:
* Click `Keyboard & Mouse` tab
* Click `Keyboard` / `Overview Shortcut` / `Additional Layout Options` button
* Click to expand `Caps Lock behavior`
* Enable `Make Caps Lock as additional Esc`.

### Keyboard shortcut customization (IM)

For Japanese input with US keyboard, set IM (anthy etc.) as:
* SHIFT-SPACE: 全角かな入力 (hiragana mode) 変換キー equivalent
* CTRL-SPACE: 英数半角入力 (latin mode) 無変換キー equivalent

## LibreOffice

The version of LibreOffice available on Debian testing environment has some
glitches more often than the version available on Debian stable environment.
Issues for printing to Hagaki was the killer bug for me.

I find that the installation of [LibreOffice Debian
packages](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/?type=deb-x86_64&lang=en)
available from [the upstream LibreOffice site](https://www.libreoffice.org/) on
Debian testing environment is the least effort solution for me.  For stability,
I chose older stable 6.4.7.2-2 version aimed for business deployments (2021/12).
This enabled me to print nicely to Hagaki.
