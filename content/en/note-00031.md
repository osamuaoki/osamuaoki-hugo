## Neovim 0.7 migration

After short trial of **Neovim** (nvim) 0.5 described in [Re-learning Vim
(3)]({{< ref "note-00027.md" >}}), I went back to the good old **Vim** with
ALE.

After finding out [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (nvim) 0.7 now has native LSP
support and tools around it seems to be getting mature, I decided to check out.

I found 4 interesting projects which offer examples of best ways to use Neovim.

* DOOM-NVIM (572K effective code)
  * SRC: https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim
* LunarVim (452K effective code)
  * SRC: https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim
  * HOME: https://www.lunarvim.org/#opinionated
* AstroNvim (316K effective code)
  * SRC: https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim
  * HOME: https://astronvim.github.io/
* NvChad (108K effective code)
  * SRC: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad
  * WIKI: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/wiki (old)
  * HOME: https://nvchad.netlify.app/

Since AstroNvim seems to be interesting I tried it as the main `nvim`
configuration.  I also tried Lunar Vim since it creates the `lvim` command
which doesn't interfere with the normal `nvim` execution.  These can co-exist.

All these already use delayed loading etc., to save their start up time.  That
is not what I am after any more.  My focus is now the out-of-box usability and
the ease of configuration.

## Syntax checker

If I install `shellcheck`, both AstroNvim and LunarVim display error messages.
Nice.

## Terminal settings and modifier keys

As before, set `DEL`-code(0x7F) for Backspace and use escape sequence for Delete.
This frees the ASCII `BS` (CTRL-H) code so window jump can be mapped to `<C-H>`.

Neovim 0.7 now correctly distinguishes these modifier key combos in its own
input processing, so users can now map e.g. `<Tab>` and `<C-I>` separately.

## TODO

Let me think about adding ...

* Toggle line number
* Toggle toggle_signcolumn
