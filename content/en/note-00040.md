## Nvim configuration retrospective

I have been updating Nvim configuration with AstroNvim as described in
[Re-learning Vim (5)]({{< ref "note-00032.md" >}}) and
[Re-learning Vim (6)]({{< ref "note-00034.md" >}}).

I also build the latest Nvim in
[Building Neovim]({{< ref "note-00039.md" >}}) to be compatible with the latest
packages.

Although AstroNvim provided me with great features with simple and consistent
customization mechanism, they were still a bit overwhelming and sometimes too
much.  I needed a simpler baseline Neovim configuration platform which offers
most features as **opt-in**.

## LazyVim

A new baseline Neovim setup system
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) is published by the upstream of
the new smart delayed package loader
[ðŸ’¤lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

Its guide is available at [www.lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org/).

[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) functions as a nice baseline
  Neovim configuration system similar to
  [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) but with less
  complication. -> So I decided to switch over to this.

* LazyVim is designed to install a trivial bootstrap code and empty
  configuration template files in `~/.config/nvim`. The template files are
  meant to be customized by the user.
* LazyVim package contains non-trivial baseline configuration files and utility
  codes.
* LazyVim package itself is installed under the `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy`
  together with all other packages including the package manager
  [ðŸ’¤lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
* Installed lua packages can be managed by `:Lazy` (alternatively, `<SPACE>l`).

### Terminal emulator

The current `gnome-terminal` seems to support true color and undercurls without
much issues.

Just to be sure, I also installed `kitty` and `alacritty` which are officially
supported by [www.lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org/).

The `colorscheme` for them was adjusted to match `gnome-terminal` to ensure
readability for programs such as `mc`.

### Key bindings

* You can reach Normal mode by pressing `<ESC>`-key.
* In Normal mode, `which-key.nvim` displays the key binding.
  * for the second and following keys as you type.
  * for the first keys just by pressing `<BS>`-key after any random keys such as `<SPACE>`-key.
* Notable first keys used by native Neovim and user defined commands:
  * `<SPACE>`-key: user defined utility commands
  * `g`-key: MOVE-type commands
  * `z`-key: FOLD-type commands
  * `[`-key: PREVIOUS-type commands
  * `]`-key: NEXT-type commands
  * `<SPACE>l`-key: Lazy lua package manager
  * `<SPACE>cm`-key: Mason binary command manager

NOTE: The comment-out command is `gc` for LazyVim (it is `<SPACE>/` for AstroNvim).

### Colorscheme of Lazyvim

The default `colorscheme` for `Lazyvim` is `tokyonight`.

Now Neovim default to `vim.go.background = "dark"`.  (as of 0.9.0+)
<!-- No more needed
Since I like the
dark background, I add `vim.go.background = "dark"` to
`~/.config/nvim/lua/config/options.lua`.
-->

### `mason.nvim` support

`mason.nvim` manages binary commands used by `null-ls.nvim`.  It can be started
by `:Mason` (alternatively, `<SPACE>cm`).  To update binary commands to the
latest, just press "U".

Basically, this helps us to install requested `<packagename>` package into
`~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/<packagename>/` and make its executable
`<progname>` program accessible from Neovim in
`~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/<progname>`. So executable programs from Neovim
plugins are not the one on the main system.

As I see my situation with `:checkhelth mason`.:
```text
mason: require("mason.health").check()

```

I ended up to install following Debian packages as required system programs.

- `luarocks`
- `npm`
- `nodejs`
- `cargo`
- `python3-pip`
- `python3-venv`
- `curl`
- `wget`

See more `:h mason.nvim`

In order to make `mason.nvim` generated programs accessible from shell
prompt, I have modifies `~/.profile` to include the following:

```sh
# set PATH so it includes mason.nvim's private bin if it exists (Neovim/mason.nvim)
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/" ]; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

I also added
[~/.editorconfig](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/dot/.editorconfig)
to cope with sources using [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

I also create bash aliases:
```sh
alias v='nvim  -u NORC'
alias v0='nvim -u ~/.nvim'
alias vi='nvim'
alias view='nvim -R'
alias vimdiff='nvim -d'
```
Here, `~/.nvim` contains very simple setting.

Now that `$NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable is supported, I should think
about using this, soon.

## LazyVim customization

I created [folked LazyVim starter](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) with
my changes in `osamu` branch to keep backup of my local configuration.  I
intend to `git push -f`.  It now contains following changes.

### Update `.gitigonore`

I excluded `lazy-lock.json` from git repo.

### Opening Gzip files

Since Debian ships most documentation files as Gzipped, I enabled "gzip"
plugin for `view` purpose.

### Extra features as opt-in features

I made following extra features disabled as started.  These can be enabled via key
bindings.

* input suggestions (`nvim-cmp`, Toggle with `<leader>u<tab>`)
* input pairs (`mini.pairs`, Toggle with `<leader>u'`)
* auto format on save (`nvim-lspconfig`, Toggle with `<leader>uf`)

I also made `<leader>uu` as NOP to avoid accidental undo `u`.

### Column and Line number and, Unicode codepoint in statusline

Using `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugin/ui.lua`, I replaced clock display in statusline with Column and Line number and, Unicode codepoint as `1î‚¡: 1î‚£ [+U20]`.

### Vimdoc help files

I add access to many hidden help files available under `LOCAL ADDITIONS:` by
running
[vimdoc-lazy](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter/blob/osamu/vimdoc-lazy).

### Extra plugins

A few extra plugin supports are introduced by adding configuration files in
`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugin/` of
[my folked LazyVim starter](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) in
`osamu` branch.

* `escape.lua` for `max397574/better-escape.nvim`
* `neorg.lua` for `nvim-neorg/neorg`
* `oil.lua` for `stevearc/oil.nvim`

## Treesitter and LSP

It is a bit confusing what is all about
[Treesitter](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html) and
[LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).
Reddit gave me good intro: [Treesitter vs LSP. Differences ans overlap](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1109wgr/treesitter_vs_lsp_differences_ans_overlap/).

The [nvim-treesitter playground](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground) plugin is now integrated into Neovim v0.9, so `:InspectTree` works without installing this plugin.
