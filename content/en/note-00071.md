Here is a series of memos of me trying to use LXC/LXD and INCUS on Debian 12 (`bookworm`).

## Incus web UI

Set up port `8443` for Incus:

```console
 $ incus config set core.https_address ":8443"
```

Then start any modern browser with it URL pointing to `https://localhost:8443`.

* Don't be afraid of WARNINGS and proceed :-)
* Click "Create a new certificate" button and follow the web GUI instruction.
* Enjoy Incus web UI at [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).
