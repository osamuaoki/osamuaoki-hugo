Here is a series of memos of me trying to use LXC/LXD and INCUS on Debian 12 (`bookworm`).

I am using Incus for Debian 12 from [Zabbly package repository](https://github.com/zabbly/incus).

## Incus web UI

Set up port `8443` for Incus:

```console
 $ incus config set core.https_address ":8443"
```

Then start any modern browser with it URL pointing to `https://localhost:8443`.

* Don't be afraid of WARNINGS and proceed :-)
* Click "Create a new certificate" button and follow the web GUI instruction.
* Enjoy Incus web UI at [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).

Other UI
  https://github.com/PenningLabs/lxconsole (PYTHON)
  https://github.com/AdaptiveScale/lxdui (PYTHON)
  https://github.com/turtle0x1/LxdMosaic (JS with SQL)
  https://github.com/lxdware/lxd-dashboard (PHP)

  There are different types of implementations. lxconsole is written in Python,
  is based on the Flask web framework, and uses a database to store settings.
  On the other hand, Incus UI is a single-page application written in
  TypeScript and React and only replicates what you can do with the incus CLI
  program (i.e. works through the REST API).

  https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/stateful-uis-and-questions-about-lxd-ui-history/18302

  My comment from earlier was in response to a question about whether lxconsole
  would work with the INCUS_UI env variable, and the response remains accurate
  that no, if you want to have a web UI that you can just drop into
  /opt/incus/ui/ and have it work out immediately, then your only options are
  those UIs that rely on static files and on no other external components.

  Those more complex web interfaces will typically come with their own set of
  instructions on how to properly deploy them, what OS they support to run
  their daemon and database, how to setup the database for high-availability
  when in a cluster environment, how to perform backups of that data, â€¦
