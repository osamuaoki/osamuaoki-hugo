## GtkNotebook and GtkStack

* [GtkNotebook](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Notebook.html) under the "Containers" button
* [GtkStack](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Stack.html) under the "Containers" button

These are very similar displaying a selected page out of stacked pages.

For __GtkNotebook__, functionality to select page is automatically provided.

For __GtkStack__, functionality to select page needs external "control" widget
and it needs to be specified in the property of the GtkStack widget.  Such
external "control" widget can be:

* [GtkStackSwitcher](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/StackSwitcher.html)
  under the "Control" button (horizontal/vertical list)
* [GtkStackSidebar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/StackSidebar.html)
  under the "Control" button (vertical list)

## Buttons and Toggles

Let's see widgets offering buttons and toggles.

We have covered the followings buttons and toggles with examples:

* GtkButton — A widget that emits a signal when clicked on
* GtkCheckButton — Create widgets with a discrete toggle button
* GtkRadioButton — A choice from multiple check buttons
* GtkToggleButton — Create buttons which retain their state
* GtkSpinButton — Retrieve an integer or floating-point number from the user
* GtkFileChooserButton — A button to launch a file selection dialog

These buttons and toggles are trivial ones to understand their use case and use method:
* GtkLinkButton — Create buttons bound to a URL
* GtkSwitch — A “light switch” style toggle
* GtkScaleButton — A button which pops up a scale
* GtkVolumeButton — A button which pops up a volume control
* GtkLockButton — A widget to unlock or lock privileged operations
* GtkColorButton — A button to launch a color selection dialog
* GtkFontButton — A button to launch a font chooser dialog
* GtkAppChooserButton — A button to launch an application chooser dialog

These buttons and toggles related to Toolbar are obvious, too 
* GtkToolbar — Create bars of buttons and other widgets
* GtkToolButton — A GtkToolItem subclass that displays buttons
* GtkMenuToolButton — A GtkToolItem containing a button with an additional dropdown menu
* GtkToggleToolButton — A GtkToolItem containing a toggle button
* GtkRadioToolButton — A toolbar item that contains a radio button

So we are left with 2 intriguing buttons which seems to be related to the skipped __GtkApplicationWindow__ as I started this series with __GtkWindow__:

* GtkMenuButton — A widget that shows a popup when clicked on
    * This is used to start popover.
        * GtkPopover — Context dependent bubbles
        * GtkPopoverMenu — Popovers to use as menus
          * [GtkPopoverMenu – New widget for complex popovers](https://csorianognome.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/gtkpopovermenu-new-widget-for-complex-popovers/)
* GtkModelButton — A button that uses a GAction as model
    * https://developer.gnome.org/GAction/
    * https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GtkApplication
    * GTK4's [Overview of actions in GTK](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/actions.html)
* GtkApplication and GtkApplicationWindow
  * Introduced in GTK3 cycle
  * Key part of GTK4

I will come back later on these.

## GTK3 to GTK4 migration.

Before going any further, let's look at the GTK3 to GTK4 migration.

GTK4 has matured now (2021-07).

So when writing any more code for GTK3, we should avoid deprecated features and
widgets to minimize future efforts.

API reference of GTK4 is at https://docs.gtk.org/ now(2021-07).

I found the followings to be good references to understand differences between GTK3 and GTK4, and where GTK4 is heading to.
