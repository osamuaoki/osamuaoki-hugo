## GtkNotebook and GtkStack

* [GtkNotebook](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Notebook.html) under the "Containers" button
* [GtkStack](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Stack.html) under the "Containers" button

These are very similar displaying a selected page out of stacked pages.

For __GtkNotebook__, functionality to select page is automatically provided.

For __GtkStack__, functionality to select page needs external "control" widget
and it needs to be specified in the property of the GtkStack widget.  Such
external "control" widget can be:

* [GtkStackSwitcher](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/StackSwitcher.html)
  under the "Control" button (horizontal/vertical list)
* [GtkStackSidebar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/StackSidebar.html)
  under the "Control" button (vertical list)

## Buttons and Toggles

Let's see widgets offering buttons and toggles.

We have covered the followings buttons and toggles with examples:

* GtkButton — A widget that emits a signal when clicked on
* GtkCheckButton — Create widgets with a discrete toggle button
* GtkRadioButton — A choice from multiple check buttons
* GtkToggleButton — Create buttons which retain their state
* GtkSpinButton — Retrieve an integer or floating-point number from the user
* GtkFileChooserButton — A button to launch a file selection dialog

These buttons and toggles are trivial ones to understand their use case and use method:
* GtkLinkButton — Create buttons bound to a URL
* GtkSwitch — A “light switch” style toggle
* GtkScaleButton — A button which pops up a scale
* GtkVolumeButton — A button which pops up a volume control
* GtkLockButton — A widget to unlock or lock privileged operations
* GtkColorButton — A button to launch a color selection dialog
* GtkFontButton — A button to launch a font chooser dialog
* GtkAppChooserButton — A button to launch an application chooser dialog

These buttons and toggles related to Toolbar are obvious, too
* GtkToolbar — Create bars of buttons and other widgets
* GtkToolButton — A GtkToolItem subclass that displays buttons
* GtkMenuToolButton — A GtkToolItem containing a button with an additional dropdown menu
* GtkToggleToolButton — A GtkToolItem containing a toggle button
* GtkRadioToolButton — A toolbar item that contains a radio button

So we are left with 2 intriguing buttons which seems to be related to the skipped __GtkApplicationWindow__ as I started this series with __GtkWindow__:

The following may be partially wrong.  Just my learning note.

* [GtkMenuButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/MenuButton.html#class-details) — A widget that shows a popup when clicked on
    * This is used to start popover.
        * [GtkPopover](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Popover.html) — Context dependent bubbles
        * [GtkPopoverMenu](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/PopoverMenu.html) — Popovers to use as menus
          * [GtkPopoverMenu – New widget for complex popovers](https://csorianognome.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/gtkpopovermenu-new-widget-for-complex-popovers/)
          * [How I create a “HeaderMenu” with a Popover menu in GTK?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38907362/how-i-create-a-headermenu-with-a-popover-menu-in-gtk)
* [GtkModelButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ModelButton.html#class-details) — A button that uses a [GAction](https://developer.gnome.org/GAction/) as model
    * This is basically used with GtkApplication and GtkApplicationWindow and not for GtkWindow
    * Modelbuttons are used in Gtk.Popover and Gtk.PopoverMenu.
* [Gio.GAction](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Gio-2.0/classes/Action.html#Gio.Action) is [GAction](https://developer.gnome.org/GAction/)
    * See GTK4's [Overview of actions in GTK](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/actions.html) also.
* GtkApplication and GtkApplicationWindow
  * Introduced in GTK3 cycle
  * Key part of GTK4 (unseating GtkWindow)
  * Gtk.ApplicationWindow can handle both the application menu as well as the menubar.
* Here are a few pages related to this.
  * [The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial -- 24. Application](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/application.html)
  * [A GtkApplication with a simple GMenu and SimpleActions](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/gmenu.py.html.en)
  * [Python gi.repository.Gio.Menu() Examples](https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/84574/gi.repository.Gio.Menu)

Too much info and confusing for me.

I will come back later on these.

## GTK3 to GTK4 migration.

Before going any further, let's look at the GTK3 to GTK4 migration.

GTK4 has matured now (2021-07).  So when writing any more code for GTK3, we
should avoid deprecated features and widgets to minimize future efforts.

(My stable Desktop system environment is Debian/Bullseye which is still GTK3.)

API reference of GTK4 is at https://docs.gtk.org/ now(2021-07).

I found the followings to be good references to understand differences between GTK3 and GTK4, and where GTK4 is heading to.

* [Migrating from GTK 3.x to GTK 4 -- Preparation in GTK 3.x](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk4/stable/gtk-migrating-3-to-4.html#id-1.7.4.3)
* [Adventures in graphics APIs (2021-05)](https://blog.gtk.org/2021/05/10/adventures-in-graphics-apis/)
* [GTK happenings - A new GL Renderer, Popover Shadows, Better Input (2021-02](https://blog.gtk.org/2021/02/18/gtk-happenings/)
* [Custom widgets in GTK 4 – Introduction (2020-04)](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/04/23/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-introduction/)
    * Another big loser is GtkWindow.
        * In GTK 3, all the “popups”  (entry completion, menus, tooltips, etc) were using a GtkWindow underneath.
        * In GTK 4, most of them have been converted to popovers, and the GtkPopover implementation has been untangled from GtkWindow.
    * In addition, many pieces of toplevel-specific functionality have been broken out in separate interfaces called GtkRoot and GtkNative.
* [Custom widgets in GTK 4 – Drawing (2020-04)](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/04/24/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-drawing/)
* [Custom widgets in GTK 4 – Layout (2020-04)](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/04/27/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-layout/)
* [Custom widgets in GTK 4 – Actions (2020-05)](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/05/01/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-actions/)
* [GTK+ 4 Status Update (2018)](https://mclasen.fedorapeople.org/gtk4-devconf2018.pdf)

Also, since Nim is similar to Python, [GTK4 for Graphical User Interfaces with the Nim Programming Language](http://ssalewski.de/gtkprogramming.html) was interesting to read.
