## Backup and snapshot

For **backup**, data needs to be moved to physically separate device.  `rsync ...` is
my choice to do this.

For **snapshot**, data can stay on the same device .  `btrfs subvolume snapshot ...`
is my choice to do this.

I created [bss](https://github.com/osamuaoki/bss) script to help me do these easily
and its examples contain key parts of the settings.

This [bss](https://github.com/osamuaoki/bss) is designed for flexibility with
choice of many options, commands and arguments.

## Setup USB storage backup

I have a USB Serial-ATA HDD/SSD external case with USB connector.  I put an SSD
in it.  I configured this with the MBR partition table holding a single Btrfs
partition with GUI operations using the `gparted` package.  This Btrfs was
labeled as `BKUP_USB`.

Then, this USB device is used for a single command backup with the
[bu](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/bu) command which wraps
[bss](https://github.com/osamuaoki/bss).

This `bu` command is designed:
* to be edited easily to suite target storage usages, and
* to be invoked easily without command arguments.

The essence of the `bu` setting is listing volume label `BKUP_USB` with btrfs
subvolume directory name `Documents` as:

```
backup BKUP_USB Documents
```
When `bu` is executed while USB drive volume with label `BKUP_USB` is
connected, `bu` backs up the `Documents` directory which is a btrfs subvolume.

## Setup remote secure backup

NOTE: This section needs to be updated.

Remote backup with rsync can be secured by storing data in encrypted format.

Here are the basic tricks used in the [bss](https://github.com/osamuaoki/bss)
package offering `bss` and `luksimg`.

In order to securely backup private data using non-secure remote storage, data
needs to be encrypted.  Roughly, the following is an approach:

* create a disk image containing an encrypted filesystem
* mount the disk image un-encrypted for ease of use
    * use bind mount to offer ~/.gnupg etc.
* backup the disk image file or directory tree containing the disk image (rsync, rclone, GUI google drive)

This can be done using following tricks.

* [Making the empty disk image file](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_making_the_empty_disk_image_file)
* [Removable disk encryption with dm-crypt/LUKS](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_removable_disk_encryption_with_dm_crypt_luks)
* [Mounting encrypted disk with dm-crypt/LUKS](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_mounting_encrypted_disk_with_dm_crypt_luks)
* [Expansion of usable storage space by bind-mounting another directory](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_expansion_of_usable_storage_space_by_bind_mounting_another_directory)
* [Filesystem creation and integrity check](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_filesystem_creation_and_integrity_check) (This is Ext4, do the same for Btrfs)

### Create and format an encrypted filesystem in a disk image

```
$ dd bs=1 count=0 if=/dev/zero of=disk.img seek=7000M
$ mkdir disk
$ cryptsetup luksFormat disk.img
WARNING: ...
 ...
$ sudo cryptsetup open disk.img disk --type luks
Enter passphrase for disk.img: *****
$ ls -l /dev/mapper
total 0
crw------- 1 root root 10, 236 Nov  3 07:45 control
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       7 Nov  3 12:04 disk -> ../dm-0
$ sudo mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/disk
 ...
   ID        SIZE  PATH
    1     6.82GiB  /dev/mapper/disk

$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/disk /mnt
$ sudo chown 1000:1000 /mnt
$ sudo umount /mnt
$ cryptsetup close disk
```

### Mount and use an encrypted filesystem in a disk image

```
$ mkdir -p ~/path/to/mnt
$ sudo cryptsetup open disk.img disk --type luks
Enter passphrase for disk.img: *****
$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/disk ~/path/to/mnt
... (use files in ~/path/to/mnt as a user)
$ sudo umount /dev/mapper/disk
$ sudo cryptsetup close disk
```

In order to skip passphrase hassle, let's use Gnome keyring.

Let me store `my_pass_phrase_value` in Gnome keyring.

```
$ secret-tool store --Label='LUKS passowrd for disk.img' LUKS disk_img
```

Then, use Gnome keyring to decrypt luks device.

```
$ secret-tool lookup LUKS disk_img | \
  cryptsetup open disk.img disk --type luks --key-file -
```

This avoids storing key file data in plain text.

For `~/path/to/mnt`, use`~/Document`.  For `~/.gnupg`, `~/.ssh`, bind mount may
be an idea.
