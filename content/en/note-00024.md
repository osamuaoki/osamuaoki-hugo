Since around 2017,
[GNOME has pushed to use Meson to build its associated programs](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting).
I now have no choice but to learn
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html).

Here is my learning process note.

## Build infrastructure history

[GNU Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Autotools) on top of
[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) has been the de facto
standard for the portable build infrastructure since 1990s.

[Configure script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configure_script) generation
utility, [GNU Autoconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconf) has been a core
part of GNU Autotools but it was extremely slow to execute and was not
intuitive to customize.  Root cause of problem were requirements for:

* writing portable Bourne shell script snippets to customize it
* relying on text substitutions by not-so-much-used [M4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language))
* generating configuration files by the slow Bourne shell
* relying on [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) as the final build infrastructure
* supporting only string as the configuration data type

[CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) initially release in 2000,
addressed the first 3 issues listed in the above.

[Ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)) initially release
in 2012, addressed the 4th issue by offering the alternative smaller and faster
low level build tool of [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).

[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) initially release
in 2013, is a higher level build tool in line with the functionalities of
[GNU Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Autotools) and
[CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake).  It used
[Ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)) as its low level
build infrastructure and supports string, list and dictionary data types.

(Some of the configuration syntax of [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html)
seems to resemble [SCons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCons) initially
release in 2000.)

(Since around 2016, [CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) also supports
the use of [Ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)) as its
low level build infrastructure but still limited to the string data type.)

[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) using
[Ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)) as its backend
seems to me the winner these days with its modular and declarative simple
configuration file syntax and its execution speed.

See:
* [Blog post on Meson from Martin Pitt in 2020](https://piware.de/post/2020-11-06-meson/)
* [Comparing Meson with other build systems](https://mesonbuild.com/Comparisons.html)

## Learning Meson

[Command line options and the environment variables of Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Commands.html)
are very similar to what we use in more traditional
[GNU Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Autotools) and
[CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake), including `DESTDIR` and
`prefix`.

I read the following basic documents first:
* [Tutorial](https://mesonbuild.com/Tutorial.html) (read line-by-line)
* [FAQ](https://mesonbuild.com/FAQ.html) (read)
* [Manual](https://mesonbuild.com/Manual.html) (just browsed)
* [Modules](https://mesonbuild.com/Modules.html) (just browsed)

Meson has a well documented native support of most compiler languages.  But for
building documentation,
[HotDoc documentation](https://hotdoc.github.io/)
is the only documentation platform with the native support on
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html)
by the
[Hotdoc module](https://mesonbuild.com/Hotdoc-module.html).

Many document building activities usually involve processing files with
sed/perl/python-scripts, or XSLT-transformation-scripts.  The answer to "How do
I build documents with Meson?" involves running external commands, creating
custom targets, and creating generator objects.  The followings seem to be useful.

* [External commands](https://mesonbuild.com/External-commands.html)
    * [Reference manual: run_command()](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#run_command)
* [Generating sources](https://mesonbuild.com/Generating-sources.html)
    * [Reference manual: custom_target()](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#custom_target)
    * [Reference manual: generator()](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#generator)
* [Custom build targets](https://mesonbuild.com/Custom-build-targets.html)
    * [Reference manual: custom_target()](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#custom_target)

As for i18n,
[I18n module](https://mesonbuild.com/i18n-module.html)
provides internationalization and localization functionality.  An
implementation example can be found at
[Localization](https://mesonbuild.com/Localisation.html).

## Note on recent feature enhancements

[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) is still in pre-1.0 stage as of July
2021 and is evolving quickly.  Since the Meson version of Debian Bullseye/11 is
0.56.2, some features may not work on Debian Bullseye/11.  Notable ones are:

* [Support of reading files at configuration time with the fs module](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-57-0.html#support-for-reading-files-at-configuration-time-with-the-fs-module) (0.57 feature)
* [Support of multiple append() and prepend() in environment() object](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-58-0.html#multiple-append-and-prepend-in-environment-object) (0.58 feature)
* [Support of format string](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-58-0.html#introducing-format-strings-to-the-meson-language) (0.58 feature)
* [Support of String .replace()](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-58-0.html#string-replace) (0.58 feature)
* [Support of range() function](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-58-0.html#new-range-function) (0.58 feature)
* [Support of feed for custom_target()](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-59-0.html#the-custom_target-function-now-accepts-a-feed-argument) (0.59 feature)
* [Support of accepting files objects by the fs module](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-59-0.html#fs-module-now-accepts-files-objects) (0.59 feature)
* [Support of required and disabler arguments by the import() function](https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-59-0.html#the-import-function-gains-required-and-disabler-arguments) (0.59 feature)

## Learning Ninja

In order to grok [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) generated
`build.ninja`, I browsed [The Ninja build system](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html).

## Note on Meson

### Basics

Meson is for out-of-tree building.
Meson uses single quotations for the string.

For the cross platform customization, tutorial documents tend to use:
* Python3 scripts for Meson/Ninja
* POSIX shell scripts for Autotools/Makefile

### Functionalities

* `meson setup` configures the project -- `autoreconf -ivf`
* `meson configure` changes project options -- `./configure --prefix=/usr ...`
* `meson compile` builds the project -- `make`
* `meson install` installs the project -- `make install`

Please note *setup* is *configure*.  (confusing...)

### Example for `run_command()` and `custom_target()`

Here is a text conversion example to generate a shell script:

{{< snippet "examples/meson/shell/meson.build" >}}

(Please note, new `feed` feature is not used to be compatible with Meson
version 0.56.2)

This starts with this template file:
{{< snippet "examples/meson/shell/foo0" >}}

Let's configure and build script `foo`:

```
$ meson setup build       # configure
$ cd build
$ meson configure --prefix=~
$ meson compile           # build
$ meson install
```
This generates `foo` with `meson compile` and install it to `~/bin/foo` with `meson install`:
{{< snippet "examples/meson/shell/build/foo" >}}

Most compilers are well supported by Meson and there are many examples.
