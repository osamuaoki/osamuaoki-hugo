After having a loose SATA cable problem and fixed it, I happen to see `dmesg`
as:

```
$ sudo dmesg
 ...
[    2.373152] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 937703088 512-byte logical blocks: (480 GB/447 GiB)
[    2.373156] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
[    2.373158] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
[    2.373165] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
[    2.373173] sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] 468862128 512-byte logical blocks: (240 GB/224 GiB)
[    2.373179] sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off
[    2.373180] sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
[    2.373185] sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
...
```

This `doesn't support DPO or FUA` caught my attention.

I thought this is normal but just to be absolutely sure, I googled.

* Conclusion: Normal and no problem
* Reason: [Linux has all the support code but it is disabled by default for DPO or FUA](https://linux-ide.vger.kernel.narkive.com/xwztlYxD/sata-is-dpo-and-fua-ever-supported)
