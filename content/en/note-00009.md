I now map Caps to Esc via Gnome Tweaks.  So followings are not used.

## Back ground

Let's review a few interesting tricks to use Vim key bindings.

I used following as references.

## Map `kj`-key sequence to ESC in INSERT MODE

Pressing `ESC`-key to get back to NORMAL MODE from INSERT MODE is a bit
stressful since it is far from the finger home position.  I map a quick key
sequence of "`kj`" to `ESC`-key.

```
inoremap kj  <Esc>
inoremap kjk kj
```

The second mapping is to allow quick input of `kj` by `kjk`.  Without this, you
need to wait a second after entering `k` to enter `kj`.

`k` and `j` are easiest to type and unlikely under normal input situation.  I
remember this as my __Knee-Jerk-reaction__ to the distant `ESC`-key.

### Map `kj`-key sequence to `^WN` in TERMINAL MODE

Similar key sequence trick proposed for INSERT MODE can also be implemented
```
tnoremap kj  <C-W>N
tnoremap kjk kj
```
