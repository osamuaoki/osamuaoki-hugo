I see formatting consistency provided by the `black` command helps me.

The `black` is available as Debian package and its upstream is at
https://github.com/psf/black


## Lint tools before `black`

These are basic lint tools before `black`.

* `pycodestyle` (formerly called `pep8`)
* `flake8` (bundle of: `pycodestyle` + `pyflakes`).

## Install `black`


```
 $ sudo apt install python3-black
```

## Use `black`

```
 $ black a-python-code-directory/
```

or

```
 $ black a-python-code-file.py
```
## Skip Lint prigram

Line with `#NOQA` at the end are skipped by `pycodestyle` for PEP-8 lint.

Lines between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` are skipped by the `black`.


## Make `black` to work with other tools

Adding followings to `pyproject.toml` may be useful.


```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
select = C,E,F,W,B,B950
ignore = E203,W503,W504

[tool.isort]
include_trailing_comma = true
line_length = 88
multi_line_output = 3
```

Here:

* max-line-length per line
  * Black default is 88 ch/line https://github.com/psf/black#line-length
  * Ignore `E501` for line too long (82 > 79 characters)
* [pep8 Warning / Error codes](https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes)
  * `E203` for https://github.com/psf/black#slices
  * `W503` for https://github.com/psf/black#line-breaks--binary-operators
  * `W504` for line break after binary operator (default ignored)

##  Other programs

* [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) is a Python utility /
  library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into
  sections.
* [flake8-black](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-black/ is a `flake8` plugin
  for validating Python code style with the command line code formatting tool
  `black`.
