Here is a memo of me trying to understand typical IP address usages on typical
desktop systems.

## IPv4 and IPv6 basics

* IPv4
  * 8 bit * 4 = 32 bit address space (2^32 addresses)
  * [Loopback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback): IP block=`127.0.0.0/8` (2^24 addresses) for [localhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost).
  * [Multicast IPv4 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4#Special-use_addresses) block = `224.0.0.0/4`
    * [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS): IP=`224.0.0.251`, UDP, port=5353
  * [Link-local address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address): IP block=`169.254.0.0/16` (2^16 addresses)
  * [Private IPv4 network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_addresses)
    * `10.0.0.0/8` -- `1` x Class A network with `2^24=16777216` addresses
    * `172.16.0.0/12` -- `2**4=16` x Class B networks, each with `2^16=65536` addresses
    * `192.168.0.0/16` -- `2**8=256` x Class C networks, each with `2^8=256` addresses

* IPv6
  * 16 bit * 8 = 128 bit address space (2^128 addresses)
  * [Loopback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback): IP=`::1` for [localhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost).
  * [Multicast IPv6 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Special_addresses) block = `ff00::/8`
    * [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS): IP=`ff02::fb`, UDP, port=`5353`
  * [Link-local address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address): IP block=`fe80::/10` (high 10 bits are IANA global ID, mid 54 bits are 0, low 64 bits are interface ID)
  * [Private IPv6 network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv6_addresses)
    * `fc00::/7` -- `2^16` bits for subnet ID x subnet with `2^64` addresses

For more, read [zero-configuration networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking).

My `/etc/hosts` on hostname `goofy` has:

```text
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	goofy

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

## Corresponding binary, hexadecimal, and decimal numbers

* Notable even numbers
  * `0b00000000 = 0x00 = 0`
  * `0b00010000 = 0x10 = 16`
  * `0b00100000 = 0x20 = 32`
  * `0b01000000 = 0x40 = 64`
  * `0b10000000 = 0x80 = 128`
  * `0b10101000 = 0xa8 = 168`
  * `0b11000000 = 0xc0 = 192`
  * `0b100000000 = 0x100 = 256`
* Notable odd numbers (above even number -1)
  * `0b00001111 = 0x0f = 15`
  * `0b00011111 = 0x1f = 31`
  * `0b00111111 = 0x3f = 63`
  * `0b01111111 = 0x7f = 127`
  * `0b10100111 = 0xa7 = 167`
  * `0b10111111 = 0xbf = 191`
  * `0b11111111 = 0xff = 255`
* Notable negative numbers
  * `0b11111100 = 0xfc = 252` = `-4`
  * `0b11111101 = 0xfd = 253` = `-3`
  * `0b11111110 = 0xfe = 254` = `-2`
  * `0b11111111 = 0xff = 255` = `-1`
