Here is a memo of me trying to understand typical IP address usages on typical
desktop systems.

## Corresponding binary, hexadecimal, and decimal numbers

* `0b00000000 = 0x00 = 0`
* `0b00010000 = 0x10 = 16`
* `0b00100000 = 0x20 = 32`
* `0b01000000 = 0x40 = 64`
* `0b10000000 = 0x80 = 128`
* `0b10101000 = 0xa8 = 168`
* `0b11000000 = 0xc0 = 192`
* `0b100000000 = 0x100 = 256`

* `0b00001111 = 0x0f = 15`
* `0b00011111 = 0x1f = 31`
* `0b00111111 = 0x3f = 63`
* `0b01111111 = 0x7f = 127`
* `0b10100111 = 0xa7 = 167`
* `0b10111111 = 0xbf = 191`
* `0b11111111 = 0xff = 255`

* `0b11111100 = 0xfc = 252` = `-4`
* `0b11111101 = 0xfd = 253` = `-3`
* `0b11111110 = 0xfe = 254` = `-2`
* `0b11111111 = 0xff = 255` = `-1`

## Loopback IP address

IP address for `localhost`

* In IPv4, the name `localhost` normally resolves to the loopback IP address `127.0.0.1`.
  * The entire IPv4 address block `127.0.0.0/8` = `127.xx.xx.xx` is reserved for loopback purposes.
* In IPv6, the name `localhost` resolves to a loopback IP address:
  * `::1` = `0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`

## Link-local addresses

For [zero-configuration networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking), Link-local addresses are used.

* In IPv4, `169.254.0.0/16`
  * `169.254.xx.xx`
* In IPv6, `fe80::/64`.
  * `fe80:0000:0000:0000:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx`

## Private network / Unique local address

* In IPv4 (32 bits), private network addresses are:
  * `10.0.0.0/8` -- `1` x Class A network with `2**24=16777216` addresses
    * `10.xx.xx.xx`
  * `172.16.0.0/12` -- `2**4=16` x Class B networks, each with `2**16=65536` addresses
    * `172.16.xx.xx`
    * `172.17.xx.xx`
    * ...
    * `172.31.xx.xx`
  * `192.168.0.0/16` -- `2**8=256` x Class C networks, each with `2**8=256` addresses
    * `192.168.0.xx`
    * `192.168.1.xx`
    * ...
    * `192.168.255.xx`
* In IPv6 (128 bits), unique local address is `fc00::/7`
    * `fc00:0000:0000:0000:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx` = `fc00::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx`
    * `fd00:0000:0000:0000:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx` = `fd00::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx`
