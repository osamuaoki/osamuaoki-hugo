I realized the main stream packaging practice now uses  `pyproject.toml`
instead of `setup.cfg` or `setup.py`.

I wanted to upload a package `imediff` to pipy.org repository while converting
it to use `pyproject.toml`.  Getting confused by the documentation sites which
are still actively updated to catch up with the new style to use
`pyproject.toml` etc., I managed to upload a package to pypi.org.

Here are the list of sites which I visited:

* [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) -- real site
  * [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
    * [Getting Started](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)
  * [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/)
    * [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
    * [Uploading the distribution archives](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archivesa)
* [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/) -- test site

In retrospective, I found
"[An Updated Guide to Setuptools and Pyproject.toml](https://xebia.com/blog/an-updated-guide-to-setuptools-and-pyproject-toml/)
(2023-12-19)" which documents this very concisely.

These documents and the example as the following lead me to sucess:

* https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject

The end result of my `imediff` package is available as version 2.8 at:

* https://github.com/osamuaoki/imediff (`main` branch)

The source for the debian deb-package is at `debian` branch.

## Key point for successful upload

Use of `twine check dist/*` was good way to get it acceptable to pypi.org .

Please note `pyproject.toml` needed to do the following:
```
...
## The following needed to be commented out to work with "twine check"
#license = {file = "LICENSE"}
...
```

## Pypi.org package upload procedures

### Python virtual environment

Create and start virtual environment in `~/.venv`:

```console
 $ python3 -m venv ~/.venv
 $ . ~/.venv/bin/activate
```
Please note `.` is significant here.


### pip

Install a pip package `<package_name>` with:

```console
 $ pip install -U <package_name>
```

#### `build` package

We need to set up access to the upload tool `twine`:

* deb: `apt install python3-build`
* venv: `pip install --upgrade build`

#### `keyring` package

We need to set up access to the keyring tool `keyring` (backend `secret-tool`):

* deb:`apt install python3-keyring`
* venv: `pip install --upgrade keyring`

#### `twine` package

We need to set up access to the upload tool `twine`:

* deb: `apt install twine`
* venv: `pip install --upgrade twine`

#### Update all packages to the latest

Update all packages in virtual environment:

```console
 $ pip list --outdated |tail -n +3|cut -d ' ' -f 1|xargs -n1 pip install -U
```

(I used this to avoid issues of using older tool chain while facing failed
upload as described below.  It seems the root cause was not the older tool chain.)

### Build package

Build a python package:

```console
 $ cd path/to/project_root
 $ python3 -m build
 $ twine check dist/*
```

### Get API token to the keyring

I got API tokens following their instructions:

* [test.pypi.org API token](https://test.pypi.org/help/#apitoken)
* [pypi.org API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken)

I followed [Twine: Keyring Support](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#keyring-support) to store API tokens into keyring.

For test pypi:
```console
 $ keyring set https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
Password for '__token__' in 'https://test.pypi.org/legacy/': pypi-token-value
```
For real pypi:
```console
 $ keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
Password for '__token__' in 'https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/': pypi-token-value
```

These are essential steps to make smooth uploads of packages without prompted
by `twine` as mentioned in
"Python Packaging User Guide: [Uploading the distribution archives](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives)".

Use of `~/pypirc` to avoid being prompted for your username and password every
time as mentioned in 
[Setting up TestPyPI in .pypirc](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/#setting-up-testpypi-in-pypirc)
doesn't work on my Debian system.  So use of `keyring` mentioned here is
needed.

### Upload of a python package

Test upload of a python package:

```console
 $ twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Official upload of a python package:
```console
 $ twine upload --verbose --repository pypi dist/*
```

### Leave python virtual environment

Deactivate virtual environment:

```console
 $ deactivate
```

## Retrospective on the upload trials

### Failed test upload example with `imediff`

I followed [Twine documentation](https://twine.readthedocs.io/) to build
package for `imefiff` and itried to upload to test.pypi.org.

```console
 $ cd path/to/imediff
 $ python3 -m build
...
 Successfully built imediff-2.8.tar.gz and imediff-2.8-py3-none-any.whl
 $ twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*
...
ERROR    HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
         The description failed to render in the default format of reStructuredText. See https://test.pypi.org/help/#description-content-type for more information.
```

You may use `pyproject-build` for `python3 -m build` if deb is installed.

Since keyring is properly setup, this didn't ask password.

I suppose I am doing something wrong: [Linked site for content-type](https://test.pypi.org/help/#description-content-type).

I added `README.rst`.  No success.  Something other than use of `README.md` is causing this failure.

### Test build/upload of known-good-package and its variants

I went back to the [Packaging Python
Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
and a test upload of the example
[sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) after required
modifications went flawlessly.

I replaced `LICENSE.txt` with GPL LICENSE file content from `imediff` a,d test
build it and failed as:

```console
 $ python3 -m build;twine check dist/*
 ...
Successfully built sampleproject_osamu_debian_org-3.2.0.tar.gz and sampleproject_osamu_debian_org-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl

         line 2: Warning: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

```

I looked around https://github.com/pypa site and see packages such as
[build](https://github.com/pypa/build) comes with `README.md` without problem.
So long description source `README.md` may not be the source of problem.  It
has odd `license.file = "LICENSE"` in `pyproject.toml` and doesn't include it
in `METADATA` in wheel.  This `license.file` seems equivalent of official style
but this lack of inclusion gave me a hint.

This lead me to skip official `license = "LICENSE"` line in `pyproject.toml`
for GPL-replaced `sampleproject`.  It works.  So I decided to do this as
the workaround for `imediff` upload and worked.  `METADATA` in wheel doesn't
contain license file as in the `build` package.

For further investigation, I become suspicious about TeX style quotations in
GPL license text: `\`...'` and removed them but that didn't improve situation.

I also removed indentation of leading spaces and tabs and got:

```console
 $ python3 -m build;twine check dist/*
 ...
Successfully built sampleproject_osamu_debian_org-3.2.0.tar.gz and sampleproject_osamu_debian_org-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
Checking dist/sampleproject_osamu_debian_org-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl: PASSED with warnings
WARNING  `long_description_content_type` missing. defaulting to `text/x-rst`.                                                                                                
Checking dist/sampleproject_osamu_debian_org-3.2.0.tar.gz: PASSED
```

Removing leading spaces and tabs only was not good enough.

```console
 $ python3 -m build;twine check dist/*
 ...

## Note on packaging shell command `git-ime`, manpages, ...

Initially, Packaging Python Projects didn't give me easy path to package shell
command `git-ime`, manpages, ...  into pipy.org compatible wheel package, I
looked around how others do.

* [Are python package developers just not supposed to package shell scripts as a general practice?](https://discuss.python.org/t/are-python-package-developers-just-not-supposed-to-package-shell-scripts-as-a-general-practice/25665)

My reading of this thread is:

The Python packaging standards are focused on packaging Python code in a
portable way - shell scripts are inherently platform-specific, and as such the
current thinking is that they should be shipped using platform-specific
mechanisms (.deb/.rpm files or similar) rather than Python wheels.

But, nothing stopping you from shipping a wheel (with a custom build backend, or
manually put together) with the [shell script in the .data/scripts
directory](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#the-data-directory).

I realize I can have a manually run additional script as my post-installer by
creating an entry point `imediff_install` in addition to the main `imediff` as:
```
[project.scripts]  # Optional
imediff = "imediff:main"
imediff_install = "imediff:install"
```

## Interesting programs

### [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel)

cibuildwheel runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions,
Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds
and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

### [sh](https://github.com/amoffat/sh/tree/develop)

sh is a full-fledged subprocess replacement for Python 3.8 - 3.11, and PyPy
that allows you to call any program as if it were a function.
