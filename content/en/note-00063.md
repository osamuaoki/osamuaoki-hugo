I wanted to upload a package `imediff` to pipy.org repository.  Here is how I
am trying to do it.

## Setup keyring

We need to set up access to the keyring tool `keyring` (backend `secret-tool`):

* deb:`apt install python3-keyring`
* venv: `pip install --upgrade keyring`

## Setup Twine

We need to set up access to the upload tool `twine`:

* deb: `apt install twine`
* venv: `pip install --upgrade twine`

## Get API token to keyring

I got API tokens following their instructions:

* [test.pypi.org API token](https://test.pypi.org/help/#apitoken)
* [pypi.org API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken)

I followed [Twine: Keyring Support](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#keyring-support) to store API tokens into keyring.

For test pypi:
```sh
 $ keyring set https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
Password for '__token__' in 'https://test.pypi.org/legacy/': pypi-token-value
```
For real pypi:
```sh
 $ keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
Password for '__token__' in 'https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/': pypi-token-value
```
## Failed test upload with `imediff`

I followed [Twine documentation](https://twine.readthedocs.io/) to build
package for `imefiff` and upload to test.pypi.org.

```sh
 $ cd path/to/imediff
 $ python3 -m build
...
 Successfully built imediff-2.8.tar.gz and imediff-2.8-py3-none-any.whl
 $ twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*
...
ERROR    HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
         The description failed to render in the default format of reStructuredText. See https://test.pypi.org/help/#description-content-type for more information.
```

You may use `pyproject-build` for `python3 -m build` if deb is installed.

Since keyring is properly setup, this didn't ask password.

I suppose I am doing something wrong: [Linked site for content-type](https://test.pypi.org/help/#description-content-type).

I added `README.rst`.  No sucess.

## Test upload of known-good-package

I went back to the [Packaging Python
Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
and a test upload of the example
[sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) after required
modifications went flawlessly.

I realized the main stream packaging practice now uses  `project.toml` instead of `setup.cfg` or `setup.py`.

## Packaging of `imediff` with `project.toml`

Instead of revising `setup.cfg` used in `imediff`, I decided to migrate this package to
`project.toml`.

It took me a while to do this by reading various documents:

* [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) -- real site
  * [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
    * [Getting Started](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)
  * [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/)
    * [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
    * [Uploading the distribution archives](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archivesa)
* [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/) -- test site

In retrospective, I found
"[An Updated Guide to Setuptools and Pyproject.toml](https://xebia.com/blog/an-updated-guide-to-setuptools-and-pyproject-toml/) (2023-12-19)" which
documents this very concisely.

### Note on packaging shell command `git-ime`, manpages, ...

Initially, Packaging Python Projects didn't give me easy path to package shell command `git-ime`, manpages, ...
into pipy.org compatible wheel package, I looked around how others do.

* [Are python package developers just not supposed to package shell scripts as a general practice?](https://discuss.python.org/t/are-python-package-developers-just-not-supposed-to-package-shell-scripts-as-a-general-practice/25665)

My reading of this thread is:

The Python packaging standards are focused on packaging Python code in a
portable way - shell scripts are inherently platform-specific, and as such the
current thinking is that they should be shipped using platform-specific
mechanisms (.deb/.rpm files or similar) rather than Python wheels.

But, nothing stopping you from shipping a wheel (with a custom build backend, or
manually put together) with the [shell script in the .data/scripts
directory](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#the-data-directory).

I realize I can have a manually run additional script as my post-installer by creating an entrypoint as something like:
```
[project.scripts]
imediff_post_installer = "imediff.__main__:installer"
```

### TODO

I need to verify the above approach.

(TODO: There may be better automated way to run the post installation script.)


## Interesting programs

### [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel)

cibuildwheel runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions,
Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds
and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

### [sh](https://github.com/amoffat/sh/tree/develop)

sh is a full-fledged subprocess replacement for Python 3.8 - 3.11, and PyPy
that allows you to call any program as if it were a function.
