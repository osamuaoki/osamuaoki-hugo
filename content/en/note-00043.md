This is based on `nautilus` version 43.2 in 2023 (Debian/Bookworm).

## Gnome Files

"Gnome Files" (a.k.a `nautilus`) is the default file manager for GNOME desktop
environment.  It is rather a simple file manager with primitive
functionalities, but it can be extended to offer rich features.


## `gnome-terminal` started from `nautilus` using extension

The `nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal` package is automatically installed when
`gnome-terminal` is installed and enables `nautilus` GUI to start
`gnome-terminal` CLI session.  There are 2 ways.

* Left click "`â‹®`"-icon at the right of directory box in the top bar.
* Right click folder icon for directory in the right pane.

The current directory of started terminal is intuitively set by GUI.

You can copy file/directory paths selected on the GUI dialogue to the terminal
prompt.

This is the most useful extension of `nautilus` for me and is written in C++
using `libnautilus-extension4` as its backend.

## Extension methods

There are mainly 3 paths to extend `nautilus`.

* Extension using `libnautilus-extension4` from C/C++ code
* Extension using `python3-nautilus` from Python code
* Extension using script interface of `nautilus`

### Extension using `libnautilus-extension4` from C/C++ code

This is a full-featured extension but require some learning before using it.

### Extension using `python3-nautilus` from Python code

This is a full-featured extension but require less learning before using it.

You must install `python3-nautilus` for this.

You can process selected files etc., by placing an extension Python code which
subclasses `Nautilus.MenuProvide` to `python3-nautilus` in
`~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions`.

* [How to write Nautilus extensions with nautilus-python (2022-10-03)](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-write-nautilus-extensions-with-nautilus-python)

Due to recent changes of `nautilus` and GTK(3->4), some published extensions
don't function as expected.  So this is non-trivial.

### Extension using script interface of `nautilus`

This is a simpler and older interface to `nautilus`.

You can run a script on selected files etc., by placing a script in
`~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts`.  `nautilus` passes its selection
to script using the value of certain environment variables.

  * There is an example `organize.py` which organizes image files by the date
    information in EXIF.
* [Ubuntu: NautilusScriptsHowto (2015-04-25)](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto)

Notable variables:

* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS`
* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URI`
* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI`
* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_WINDOW_GEOMETRY`

## Review of extensions

There are many extensions. I am mostly using basic Debian packaged extensions
only. Here are my thoughts on them.  I may be incorrect.

* `libnautilus-extension4`-type extension
  * DEB: `nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal` -- above mentioned (essential)
  * DEB: `nautilus-image-converter` -- resize and rotate images (optional)
  * DEB: `seahorse-nautilus` -- encrypt/decrypt files (optional)
  * Not-installed
    * [nautilus-annotations](https://gitlab.gnome.org/madmurphy/nautilus-annotations) -- Annotate files and directories
    * [nautilus-launch](https://github.com/madmurphy/nautilus-launch) -- launchers via right-click menu
* `python3-nautilus`-type extension
  * [Nautilus-fileconverter-43](https://github.com/Lich-Corals/Nautilus-fileconverter-43) -- convert images, audio files and video (convert HEIC or DOC files are not easy to be included in this)
  * Not installed:
    * DEB: `nautilus-admin` ([stalled upstream](https://github.com/brunonova/nautilus-admin)) -- no `gedit` for root operation.
    * DEB: `nautilus-hide` ([stalled upstream](https://github.com/brunonova/nautilus-hide))  -- why hide?
    * [nautilus-copypath](https://github.com/ronen25/nautilus-copypath) and [nautilus-copy-path](https://github.com/chr314/nautilus-copy-path) -- copy path, URI, name or content  -- native copy is sufficient (also outdated for GTK4, not easy to fix)
* script-type extension
  * `organize.py` [demonstrates usefulness of this simple extension method](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-extend-the-gnome-nautilus-file-manager-with-custom-scripts)

## Practical extension

If you want to run a simple script on GUI selected files, practical approach is
to use the script-type extension.

Here is an example to convert iPhone HEIC image into JPEG and Microsoft Word
document into PDF.  You can see its execution log with `journalctl -f`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
__exec() {
  systemd-cat -p 3 -t "${0##*/}" "$@"
}

if [ "$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI" = "${NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI#file://}" ]; then
  # not starting with file://
  __exec echo "Not local path: '$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI'"
else
  echo "$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS" | {
    while true; do
      read FILE_PATH
      case "$FILE_PATH" in
      *.HEIC | *.heic)
        __exec heif-convert "$FILE_PATH" "${FILE_PATH%.*}.jpeg"
        ;;
      *.doc | *.wri | *.rtf | *.odt | *.DOC | *.WRI | *.RTF)
        __exec lowriter --headless --convert-to pdf "$FILE_PATH"
        ;;
      "")
        break
        ;;
      *)
        __exec echo "Unknown file: '$FILE_PATH'"
        ;;
      esac
    done
  }
fi
```

This is very trivial coding and very handy extension of `nautilus`.

## Thoughts

`organize.py` may be adopted to use `python3-nautilus` with some GUI to select
output directory style, or even adjust timestamps.
