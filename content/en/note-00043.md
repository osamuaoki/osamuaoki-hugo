This is based on `nautilus` version 43.2 in 2023.

## Gnome Files

"Gnome Files" (a.k.a `nautilus`) is the default file manager for GNOME desktop
environment.  It is rather a simple file manager with primitive
functionalities, but it can be extended to offer rich features.

I consider following packages as essential and installed these:

* nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal (recommended by gnome-terminal)
* python3-nautilus (needed to support extensions)
* nautilus-image-converter

I am interested but doing without these packages to keep things simple:

* nautilus-hide
* seahorse-nautilus
* nautilus-admin

## `gnome-terminal` from `nautilus`

There are 2 ways to start `gnome-terminal` from `nautilus` using
`nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal`.

* Left click `â‹®` at the right of directory box in the top bar.
* Right click folder icon for directory on the right pane.

This enables me to start a terminal session at the intuitive current directory.
I find this is the most useful feature to access CLI shell prompt.

## Extension via python3-nautilus

This is a full-featured and newer interface to `nautilus`.

You can process selected files etc., by placing an extension which subclasses
`Nautilus.MenuProvide` to `python3-nautilus` in
`~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions`.

## Extension with script

This is a simpler and older interface to `nautilus`.

You can run a script on selected files etc., by placing a script in
`~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts`.  `nautilus` passes its selection
to script using the value of certain environment variables.

* [Ubuntu: NautilusScriptsHowto (2015-04-25)](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto)

Notable variables:

* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS`
* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URI`
* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI`
* `NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_WINDOW_GEOMETRY`

There is `organize.py` which organizes image files by the date information in
EXIF.
