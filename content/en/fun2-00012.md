## Debug: level 3

<!--  vim to do :%s#/home/osamu/proj/fun2prog/fun2prog/hello/#/path/to/#gc -->

The GNU debugger (GDB) make you look into binary programs.

If you do not mind reading the code in the assembler, no source code is required.

The GDB works even better if the program is compiled with the `-g` option and
the source code is kept in place on the same machine after the compilation with
the `-g` option.  See [ELF: Compile hello-gdb](/en/2013/08/17/fun2prog-elf/#compile-hello-gdb).

### Detached debugging symbols

The Debian system provided library packages have no debugging symbols in them.

The `dh_strip`(1) is normally used to strip executables, shared libraries, and
some static libraries in those packages.

The `dh_strip`(1) is also used to generate a separate *-dbg package with
"`dh_strip --dbg-package=foo-dbg`".

The low level operation to enable detached debugging symbols is described in
the `objcopy`(1) manpage under "`--only-keep-debug`" and
"`--add-gnu-debuglink`".  (You can strip binary with the `strip`(1) command,
too.)

Examples for the path to the key file of library and its debugging symbols

|package type |package name |path to the key file |
| --- | --- | ---|
|library |`libfoo` |`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfoo.so` |
|debug symbols|`libfoo-dbg` |`/usr/lib/debug/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfoo.so` |

When ever GDB executes a function in the stripped library
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfoo.so` file, GDB shipped with Debian obtains its
debugging symbols from the `/usr/lib/debug/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfoo.so`
file.

TIP: Debian wanted to strip debug symbols from the shipped binary packages
while FSF wished to keep them.  This was one of the reason for Debian to become
independent of FSF.  Now we have detached debugging symbol packages which
solves this difference. See [Debian's Debugging Debacle: the Debrief](http://debconf6.debconf.org/comas/general/proposals/64.html).

### Source file path

GDB also use the corresponding C source file path and C source line information
stored in the ELF file as described in [ELF: readelf -wL](/en/2013/08/17/fun2prog-elf/#readelf-wl) to
display them at the proper address.

GDB searches file, e.g., `foo.c` as follows without recursion:

* Exactly `foo.c` in the current working directory.
* Some file location based on the file location recorded in the ELF file and the **substitution rule**.
    * Exactly `/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c` as recorded in the ELF file. (default)
    * Exactly `/home/bar/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c` with "`set substitute-path /usr/src /home/bar`".
* Exactly `/mnt/cross/foo.c` if the source path is set to `/mnt/cross`.
    * GDB command prompt: "`directory /mnt/cross`" (`:` separated list possible)
    * GDB command argument: "`gdb -d /mnt/cross`" (multiple `-d` options possible)

If you are debugging a locally compiled binary, the C source file path stored in
the ELF and the actual C source file path should match.  So GDB should have no difficulty
finding them.

If you are debugging a packaged binary, you should obtain its corresponding
source package and expand it into a source tree, first.  For this case, the C
source file path stored in the compiled ELF and the actual C source file path
on your system should be different but most likely should share taling portion
of the path.

Use of the **substitution rule** is usually the wise choice and the most
elegant one.  But sometimes, it may be required to use a brute force approach:

```
$ gdb $(find src_path -type d -printf '-d %p ') prog
```

### gdb hello-gdb

Here we practice to walk through a program `hello-gdb` with GDB.

Let's start loading `hello-gdb` ELF binary generated by GCC with the `-g`
option in [ELF: Compile hello-gdb](/en/2013/08/17/fun2prog-elf/#compile-hello-gdb) to GDB.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb1.1.log" >}}


Now you are at a interactive GDB prompt with `(gdb)`.

Let's set up several breakpoints.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb1.2.log" >}}


As you see, not all C source lines translate to independent lines.  Breakpoint 3 and 5 stops at the same address.

Let's run program while stopping at line 3, 5 , and 6.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb1.3.log" >}}


Here "inferior" is an object generated by GDB to represent the state of each
program and typically corresponds to a process but more general.

Let's start again.

* make sure to install the `libc6-dbg:amd64` package containing "Embedded GNU C Library: detached debugging symbols".
* start GDB less noisily with the `-q` option.
* list source in the assembly code in various ways.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.1.log" >}}


For GDB, just typing `disas` is as good as typing `disassemble`.

GDB also supports TAB completion to expand `disas`+TAB into `disassemble`.

It is quite ammusing to see some hex codes such as `c3` (ASCII character "]")
in `amd64` which are the same ones as `i386` with the same meaning "return from
a function".

Let's read the assembler code here.  The `%rdi` register holds the 1st function
argument passed to the `puts` function according to the ABI described in
[ GCC: Assembler code](/en/2013/08/17/fun2prog-gcc/#assembler-code).  Its value is set to 0x40067c.

Let's see what is there using the examine memory command for string.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.2.log" >}}


OK. This memory data matches the original C function definition.

Let's trace program execution a bit slowly this time.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.3.log" >}}


You are at the start of the `main` function.

There are few basic stepping commands to walk through program with GDB.

* The `next` command goes to the next line in the C source without stepping into
the child function.
* The `step` command goes to the next line in the C source possibly stepping into
the child function.
* The `nexti` and `stepi` commands moves slowly by the line based on the
assembler code instead of the C source.

Let's trace slowly to play with calling of `printf`.

* Verify initial value of the `%edi` register with the `info reg ...` command.
* Move to the next assembler code line with `nexti`.
* Verify the first function argument value in the `%edi` register with the `info reg ...` command.
* Tweak the `%edi` register value to point 1 byte forward to show the **power of GDB.**
* Verify the updated first function argument value.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.4.log" >}}


Let's step into the `printf` function with `step`.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.5.log" >}}


Since required detached debugging symbols are properly installed by the
`libc6-dbg:amd64` package into its proper path
`/usr/lib/debug/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, you see the symbol `_IO_puts` is
resolved.

I used "`apt-get source eglibc`" to get the source files for the libc library
used on the Debian system and copied the `ioputs.c` file from the
`eglibc-*.**/libio/ioputs.c` file into the current directory in advance to
enable the C source code display.  You can blame me going easy but ...

Let's get out of the `_IO_puts` function using the `finish` command which
finishes child function and returns to the parent function.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.6.log" >}}


Now you are back to the `main` function.

Let's finish by continuing.


{{< snippet "examples/hello/c/hello-gdb2.7.log" >}}


Please note that **the program output lacks "H" in "Hello"** since I tweaked the program execution via GDB.

This is just a simple walk through but you get roughly what GDB can do.

### gdb prime8-gdb

The [Library: libpthread](/en/2013/08/17/fun2prog-library/#libpthread) had a buggy `prime8.c` code.  Let's check what was wrong under GDB.

<!-- Here I cheat since I had prime8.xxx as prime8.c in the above. -->

Let's compile  `prime8.c` with `-g` as `prime8-gdb` and run it to create the `core` file as [ELF: Core dump](/en/2013/08/17/fun2prog-elf/#core-dump), then analyze it with GDB.

Compiling `prime8.c` with `-g` as `prime8-gdb` and check core under GDB.

{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime8-core.log" >}}


Alternatively, let's run `prime8-gdb` under GDB.

Compiling `prime8.c` with `-g` as `prime8-gdb` and running it under GDB.

{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime8.log" >}}


I see the cause of the bug clearly in the result of both methods.  Assignment
at `prime8.c:108` should not be done if no prime numbers were found (returning
`NULL`) from the calculation in the thread.  So I created `prime9.patch` to
append only when the thread finds some prime numbers.

Creating and compiling `prime9.c` with `-g` as `prime9-gdb` and running it.

{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime9.log" >}}


Oops, still something is wrong here.  (I see I was careless with iteration boundaries.)

Let's continue debugging ...

### gdb prime-gdb

Let's fix the `ptime9.c` code by:

* split this into `prime.c`, `prime.h`, `checkprime.c` and `subthread.c` files.
* keep each `*.c` file to contain only one function in it.
* make `TMAX` as variable `tmax`.
* fix bugs by carefully going over iteration boundaries.
* use "`set trace-commands on`" under the batch command execution.

`prime.c`


{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime.c" >}}


Here, 3 lines in `prime.c` have been corrected (bugs!).

* line 14: "`<=`" -> "`<`"
* line 23: adjust the loop stepping.
* line 26: start from the next integer.

`prime.h`


{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime.h" >}}


Please note the use of `extern` in the `prime.h`.

Then here are supporting sources.

`checkprime.c`


{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/checkprime.c" >}}


`subthread.c`


{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/subthread.c" >}}


Now we should have good program.

Compiling `prime.c` and related files with `-g` as `prime-gdb` and running it without hitting bugs.

{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime.log" >}}


This is running nicely without hitting bugs for all input range.

Let's run this program under the batch mode of GDB to verify its internal
situation where it used to segfaults.

TIP: Use of "`set trace-commands on`" enables tracing of commands under the
batch mode.

Running `prime-gdb` under GDB. (session #1)

{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime-gdb1.log" >}}


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library[Native POSIX Thread
Library (NTPL)] uses
[light-weight process (LWP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-weight_process)
to enable the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads[POSIX thread
(pthread)] on the modern Linux system.

Please note that the breakpoint defined with condition stops just before
the previous segfault location (`i = 61, 62, 63`).

Let's run this program again creating a breakpoint at the
start of `subthread.c`.   Also, let's change `tmax` value from `64` to `4`.

Running `prime-gdb` under GDB. (session #2)

{{< snippet "examples/prime/c-pthread2/prime-gdb2.log" >}}


Please note the backtrace generated by `bt`:

* `bt` lists all stack frames of the thread on which the breakpoint stopped.
    * On the main thread, it reaches `main`.
    * On the sub thread, it does not reach `main` but reaches NULL pointer function via `start_thread()` and `clone()`.
* `bt full`  lists all stack frames and local variables of the thread.
    * Uninitialized variables show bogus valus.
* `thead apply all bt` lists all stack frames of all running threads.

See how a user defined command `xprint` is defined and a sequence of commands
at breakpoint is auto-executed via `command`.

### GDB TUI

Although normal command mode GDB is powerful, it is cumbersome to keep typing
"`list`", "`print ...`", "`info break`", and "`info reg`", ... just to see what
is going on.

That is where GDB Text User Interface (TUI) comes in.  Wile you are using GDB:

* Type "Ctrl-X" and "Ctrl-A" (or "Ctrl-X" and "a") to get into the TUI mode.
* Type "Ctrl-X" and "Ctrl-A" (or "Ctrl-X" and "a") again to get out of the TUI mode and back to the normal command prompt.
* Change the screen layout by "`la src`", "`la asm`", "`la split`", "`la regs`", "`la next`", or "`la prev`". (`la` is short for `layout`)
* Change the screen focus by "`fs cmd`", "`fs src`", "`fs asm`", "`fs split`", "`fs regs`", "`fs next`", or "`fs prev`". (`fs` is short for `focus`)
* Change the register window by "`tui reg general`", "`tui reg float`", "`tui reg next`", or "`tui reg all`".
* Refresh the screen by "`refresh`" or "Ctrl-L".
* Change active window by "Ctrl-X" and "o".
* Check window status by "`info win`".

For more, read "`info gdb TUI`" from the shell prompt.

TIP: Use "`gdb -tui`" or "`gdbtui`" in place of "`gdb`" to start GDB in the TUI mode.
