This is an updated guide for Debian 12 `bookworm`.  The [older deprecated guide]({{< ref note-00011.md>}}) was used as its base.

## Workstation usability

Let me update note on configuring and administrating my workstation under
post-Debian Bookworm (12) GNU/Linux in testing.

This is non-hardware specific notes and tips.

For the hardware specific notes and tips, see:
 * [Thinkpad T14 Gen 1]({{<ref "note-00010.md" >}}) -- `hostname=goofy`
 * [Sony Vaio SVT1313]({{<ref "note-00036.md" >}}) -- `hostname=casper`

## System installation

### Initial installation by `debian-installer`

The initial installation by the `debian-installer` should skip "Desktop environment" task to make it light GUI-less install.

This installs (mostly) packages with `Priority:` values in `required`, `important` and `standard`.

I usually install non-Desktop system first to make it quick.  In this case,
`task-desktop` is added via `aptitude` to support GNOME Desktop at the end of
the following "Initial setup (manual)" section and the full control of network
connections by the Network Manager is enabled by commenting out "The primary
network interface" section in `/etc/network/interfaces` manually.

### Initial setup (manual)

I found running following provides convenient work environment for the normal
installation.  (For the virtual environment installation, you may skip some
parts.)

* Use "CTRL-ALT-F?" (`?` can be 1-6) to access Linux virtual terminal login
  prompt, if yor are at GUI prompt.  Otherwise, you are already at it.
  * login to `root` account if you set the password for `root` during
    its installation.
  * login to your primary user account if you didn't set password for `root`,
    and then execute `sudo bash -i` to login to `root` account using the
    primary user's password.
* Execute `apt-get update && apt-get install aptitude sudo vim mc wget nano-`
* Add [configuration file for personal DEB package repository]({{< ref "note-00033" >}}#setting-up-secure-apt-cliant).
* Set-up user group for UID=1000 user by adding membership to additional groups:
  * `adm`
  * `backup`
  * `dialout`
  * `dip`
  * `games`
  * `mail`
  * `src`
  * `staff`
  * `sudo`  --  by adding this, you enable sudo with password
  * `www-data`
* Set-up sudo (see below)
* Set-up ssh server (optional)
* Set-up GNOME desktop (if not installed via installer)

For passwordless operation, configure `sudo` by adding `/etc/sudoers.d/passwordless` as:

```shell
# No passowrd required for the user in sudo group
# please note the last match wins configuration
%sudo ALL = (ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
# No password for 8 hours
#Defaults timestamp_timeout = 480
#Defaults timestamp_type = global
```
NOTE: Please note that the last matching configuration is active for `sudo`.

### Initial setup (automatic)

Running `initial-setup` script found at my repository should set up the same as
the above [manual case](#initial-setup-manual).

* https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/halexec/initial-setup

NOTE: See [Personal DEB package repository]({{< ref "note-00033.md" >}}) for how personal repo
is created and used.

### Tidy-up package installation status for aptitude.

Since I use `aptitude` as the primary package maintenance tool, I usually
tidy-up package auto install flags (`M`) missing for some libraries after the
initial install.

Use of `~i!~M~poptional` in `l` prompt in `aptitude` to
set library packages as auto-installed.  If some of them are not used by other
program, let them remove.

Now you can verify intentionally installed packages with:

```shell
$ aptitude search '~i!~M~poptional'
```

(This intensionally ignores some outdated packages with priority=extra packages.)

### Install typical packages

Typically, installing `00-typ` and `00-notex` task packages from the
[personal repo]({{< ref "note-00033.md" >}}) sets up a decent workstation.

### Set-up GRUB (optional)

In order to probe OSs on other drives, add a following line to
`/etc/default/grub`:

```shell
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

This is good idea for dual-boot on MBR disk.

But this is not so robust for btrfs.

#### Multi-boot with GRUB

For more robust multi-boot, I usually add following as `/etc/grub.d/40_fixed_linux` (The first line should be #!/bin/bash without space. Intentional mistype to avoid missing line):

```shell
#!/bin/sh
exec tail -n +3 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the
# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change
# the 'exec tail' line above.
menuentry 'Debian GNU/Linux --- main SSD' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-fixed-fe3e1db5-6454-46d6-a14c-071208ebe4b1' {
        load_video
        insmod gzio
        if [ x$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi
        insmod part_gpt
        insmod btrfs
        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root fe3e1db5-6454-46d6-a14c-071208ebe4b1
        echo    'Loading Linux from /dev/nvme0n1p5 ...'
        linux   /@rootfs/vmlinuz root=UUID=fe3e1db5-6454-46d6-a14c-071208ebe4b1 ro rootflags=subvol=@rootfs  quiet
        echo    'Loading initial ramdisk from /dev/nvme0n1p5 ...'
        initrd  /@rootfs/initrd.img
}
menuentry 'Debian GNU/Linux --- sub SSD' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-fixed-51f9cd11-30b3-4d99-b2ed-fe411fa22ee6' {
        load_video
        insmod gzio
        if [ x$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi
        insmod part_gpt
        insmod btrfs
        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 51f9cd11-30b3-4d99-b2ed-fe411fa22ee6
        echo    'Loading Linux from /dev/nvme1n1p1 ...'
        linux   /@rootfs/vmlinuz root=UUID=51f9cd11-30b3-4d99-b2ed-fe411fa22ee6 ro rootflags=subvol=@rootfs  quiet
        echo    'Loading initial ramdisk from /dev/nvme1n1p1 ...'
        initrd  /@rootfs/initrd.img
}
```

If you have multiple Debian system installed, you should make a backup copy
of `/boot/efi/EFI/debian/grub.cfg` to protect it gets overridden by installing
the second Debian system.

See https://wiki.debian.org/Btrfs%20migration .


## Re-install and UID/GID issues

UID and GID used by some applications are not fixed.  So, if you reinstall the
exact same packages in a different order, you end up assigning UID and GID for
the application.

UID in range between 101-999 such as ones for `avahi`, `saned`, `colord`,
`_ssh`, ...  are the most susceptible on this issue.

`apt-cacher-ng` needs special attention.

## EFI-based firmware updates

Install `gnome-firmware` package and invoke GUI to update firmware on devices
supported by `fwupd` using [Linux Vendor Firmware Service](https://fwupd.org/).

Many firmware data can be updated using `gnome-firmware`.

### Workaround for some firmware

Some firmware devices may experience some problem to be updated by
`gnome-firmware`.

Most notable one on my system was "Lenovo System Firmware".  (I don't know if
this was version dependent or not.) I used vendor's BIOS update offered as
bootable CD and made USB key containing it image data:

 * https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t14-type-20ud-20ue/downloads/driver-list/component?name=BIOS%2FUEFI

If the BIOS options `Security > Secure Boot` is enabled, it may restrict booting
up from the BIOS Update bootable CD image, you may need to disabled the Secure Boot option to use it.

If Windows 10 or 11 is installed, you may need to reenable Secure Boot after
this operation.

## Desktop customization

These settings also need to be set again after some major update of GNOME.

### GUI Desktop customization

The `gnome-tweak` package installed as a dependency of `gnome` package helps to tweak the system.

Although I don't use this feature, once [GNOME Shell
integration](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep)
is installed to the Chrome browser, you can adjust locally installed GNOME
extensions via browser from [GNOME Extension web
site](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/).

### Terminal customization

* Use `MONO 14` or equivalent (HACK [NERD FONT](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) MONO)
  * Install `*.ttf` files into ``~/.fonts/` for a single user or `/usr/local/share/fonts/` for system wide installation.
* Add "080x24", "080x43", "127x43"
* Disable "F10"
* Set shell as login shell if you want anything other than Bash.

### Right mouse click with single button

For Mac or some Sony Vaio with single tap pad button, the following allows
proper secondary-click (or even middle-click).

* Tweaks
* -> "Keyboard and Mouse" tab
* -> "Mouse Click Emulation" section
  * -> Check on "Area"

### Keyboard shortcut customization (GNOME Settings -- launcher)

* `SUPER-C`: launch calculator
* `SUPER-E`: launch email client
* `SUPER-B`: launch web browser

### Keyboard shortcut customization (GNOME Settings -- custom shortcut)

* `SUPER-\`: Open terminal

```shell
Name     Terminal
Command  gnome-terminal
Shortcut SUPER-\
```
(`SUPER-\` is easier to type than `SUPER-T`.)

### Keyboard shortcut customization (Input Method)

#### New better way with GNOME extension

- Installed my GNOME extension: [Quick switching of input method and touchpad](https://github.com/osamuaoki/inputmethod-shortcuts) -- source
  - [GNOME extension: Input method and touchpad shortcuts](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6066/shortcuts-to-activate-input-methods/)
- Log out and log in to GNOME
- Disabled normal `SUPER-SPACE` and `SUPER-SHIFT-SPACE` shortcuts in "Settings" -> "Keyboard" -> "Keyboard Shortcuts" -> "Typing".
  - If you don't intend to use `SUPER-SPACE` and `SUPER-SHIFT-SPACE` shortcuts in below, this is not required.
- Enabled shortcuts from GNOME shell extension preference menu as:
  - `SUPER-SPACE`: English (US)
  - `SUPER-SHIFT-SPACE`: Mozc
  - `SUPER-CTRL-SPACE`: English (international)
  - `SUPER-ALT-SPACE`: Anthy

![prefs.js](/img/InputMethods.png)


For other extensions I use, see [GNOME extensions for better UX]({{<ref "note-00045.md">}}).

#### Old hackish way with `gdbus`

**This is for historical record.**

For selecting IM deterministically (instead of Super-SPACE toggles), bind
javascript MACRO to keys by `Keyboard Shortcuts`.

* `SUPER-ENTER`: English (US)
* `SUPER-SHIFT-ENTER`: Mozc
* `SUPER-CTRL-ENTER`: English (international)
* `SUPER-ALT_ENTER`: Anthy

(I use "ENTER"-combos for shortcuts to enter easily with both hands.)

For example, `inputSources[0]` (the first selection item in the GNOME input source menu) is English (US) and if you want to use SUPER-ENTER to switch to US, you need to set as:
```shell
Name     IM_0
Command  gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/Shell --method org.gnome.Shell.Eval  "imports.ui.status.keyboard.getInputSourceManager().inputSources[0].activate()"
Shortcut SUPER-ENTER
```
Please make sure to enter the above **Command** in a single line.

Since 2022, we must install
[Unsafe Mode Menu](https://github.com/linushdot/unsafe-mode-menu) extension locally as instructed by the upstream.

This local extension can be activated using "GNOME extensions" (in `gnome-shell-extensions` deb package).

![extension screen](/img/extensions.png)

This "Unsafe mode" can be enabled via GNOME right top corner dialog.

![unsafe mode screen](/img/unsafe-mode.png)

The history of how I came to the above is recorded in [GNOME shell changes]({{<ref note-00044.md>}}).

### Note on non usable shortcut key combos for super

- Any use of `SUPER`+`modifier`+`SPACE` or `SUPER`-`SPACE` breaks normal `SUPER`-`SPACE` for rotating input method and bad idea
- `SUPER`-`P` seems to be unresponsive
- `SUPER`-`O` seems to be unresponsive

### Keyboard shortcut customization (IM)

For Japanese input with US keyboard, set IM (anthy etc.) configuration as:
* SHIFT-SPACE: 全角かな入力 (hiragana mode) 変換キー equivalent
* CTRL-SPACE: 英数半角入力 (latin mode) 無変換キー equivalent

See my old [Japanese input on US-keyboard (in Japanese)](/jp/2019/03/23/gnome-uskb-im-select/) and its [Google translation](https://osamuaoki-github-io.translate.goog/jp/2019/03/23/gnome-uskb-im-select/?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp#%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%81%AEim%E5%81%B4%E3%81%AE%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95).

### Keyboard shortcut customization (GNOME Tweaks)

For Vim use:
* Click `Keyboard & Mouse` tab
* Click `Keyboard` / `Overview Shortcut` / `Additional Layout Options` button
* Click to expand `Caps Lock behavior`
* Enable `Make Caps Lock as additional Esc`.


### Web browser

Although [Chromium](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/chromium) exists in the
official Debian repository, it lacks [account synchronization capability with
other devices since
2021](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/limiting-private-api-availability-in.html).
Although there are [some workarounds tips posted on
web](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67459316/enabling-chromium-to-sync-with-google-account),
installing [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) can solve this situation
for sure.

The best solution seems to be adding APT repository by adding
[/etc/apt/sources.d/google.sources](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.sources)
in DEB822-STYLE FORMAT and select the `google-chrome-stable` package.

### Mail client

For the GUI access to the remotely hosted IMAP4 mail services, use GNOME Online
accounts and Evolution.  This approach works for Gmail etc. and compatible with
using other devices such as smart phones.  Evolution can also be configured to
read locally delivered mails to mbox too.  (send+receive).

For the command line such as `reportbug` and daemon programs such as `cron` to
send mails to external hosts and local accounts, use of `exim4` as the locally
installed MTA is good idea.  With "sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config", Select
"mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail".  Everything else can
be default.

To use Gmail for smarthost, set up "Mail Server configuration" as
"smtp.gmail.com::587".  It is irrelevant for us to worry "Hide local mail name
..." since the smarthost service rewrites it anyway.  Edit
`/etc/exim4/passwd.client` as:
`smtp.gmail.com:foo.bar@gmail.com:application_password` (You need to create
`application_password` in advance.)

Whenever I wish to send out mails with "@debian.org" address, I use
ssh+sendmail (created shell script `~/bin/sendmail-p.d.o`) to access a Debian
host. (This trick may be usable for any hosts such as salsa.debian.org etc.)

I have mail configuration for:

* Evolution
* `devscripts` (add "`BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND='/home/osamu/bin/sendmail-p.d.o'`" to `~/.devscripts`)
* `reportbug` (add "`mta /home/osamu/bin/sendmail-p.d.o`" to `~/.reportbugrc`)

I usually don't bother with `fetchmail` these days.

### GRUB 2 wallpaper

Place your JPEG wallpaper graphics (JPEG) in `/boot/grub/` and run
`sudo update-grub` or `sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-efi-amd64`.

### GNOME desktop wallpaper

You can set wallpaper graphics from:

* Desktop: `Settings` -> `Background`

* Desktop: `Tweaks` -> `Appearance` -> `Background`
* Lock Screen: `Tweaks` -> `Appearance` -> `Lock Screen`
* GDM3: --- Not so easy (leave this as is)

## Command line

### Personal packages

These are my personal packages to help my command line.  The source of these are published to
my github repo and binary packages are published to my github web page.

* bss: Btrfs Subvolume Snapshot Utility
  * https://github.com/osamuaoki/bss
  * This helps me with easy backup and snapshot using btrfs.
* osamu-task: Osamu's Task Packages
  * https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-task
  * 00-cli, 00-dev, 00-doc, 00-gui, 00-jpn, 00-min, 00-notex, 00-typ
  * This helps me with installing packages as a group.
* unzip: patched unzip (`-O` and `-I` options to support encoding of filenames)
  * https://github.com/osamuaoki/unzip
  * provides unzip-i18n
  * This replaces Debian unzip program which lacks `-I` and `-O` options to
    offer functionality available under other distribution.
    * Use `unzip -Osjis filename.zip` to unzip Japanese zip files.

Build script is [repository.sh](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamuaoki-hugo/blob/main/repository.sh).
* Source is cloned first.
* Native packages are build with `debuild`
* Non-native packages use gbp-style repo and `gbp extract-orig` is run before
  `debuild`.
* `repropro` publishes build packages to github web pages.

See [Personal DEB package repository]({{<ref "note-00033.md">}}) for the method to publish and their usage

### Shell setups

* `~/bin` scripts: https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils (`hal`, `sendmail-p.d.o`)
  * Key dot files in `~/` and `~/.config` are stored in this [osamu-utils repo under dot/](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/tree/main/dot).
  * These stored dot-files are updated by `hal conf update`
  * These stored dot-files are restored to active use by `hal conf install`
* Main `vi` editor: `nvim` with `~/.config/nvim`
  * NeoVim 0.10.  See [Building Neovim]({{< ref "note-00039" >}}).
  * Configuration by [forked LazyVim starter](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) in `~.config/nvim`.  See [Re-learning Vim (7)]({{< ref "note-00040" >}}).
* Backup `vi` editor: `vim` with `~/.vim`
  * Configuration by https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim in `~/.vim`.
  * Custom package management of Vim 8 with native `packadd!`.
  * See [Re-learning Vim (2)]({{< ref "note-00007" >}}).

Frequent commands to use:

* `bash`: CLI command prompt
* `mc`: file manager for shell
* `fzf`: fuzzy finder for shell and vim.
* `rg`: recursive code search
* `bu`: local `~/bin/` script to backup data to USB drive using `bss` as its backend.  See [Backup and snapshot]({{< ref "note-00028.md" >}}).

## Test accounts

Adding extra user name for `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` with the same
UID=1000 enables to create useful test accounts.  Please make sure to create
different home directory for each user name. GDM seems to get confused by this
situation of single UID having multiple user names. So I gave up.

I decided to create accounts, for example `u1` accessible by `osamu` as group, with:

```
$ sudo adduser --comment "" u1
$ sudo adduser osamu u1
```

## LibreOffice

The version of LibreOffice available on Debian testing environment has some
glitches more often than the version available on Debian stable environment.
Issues for printing to Hagaki was the killer bug for me.

I find that the installation of [LibreOffice Debian
packages](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/?type=deb-x86_64&lang=en)
available from [the upstream LibreOffice site](https://www.libreoffice.org/) on
Debian testing environment is the least effort solution for me.  For stability,
I chose older stable 6.4.7.2-2 version aimed for business deployments (2021/12).
This enabled me to print nicely to Hagaki.
