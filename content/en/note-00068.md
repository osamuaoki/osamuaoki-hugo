Here is a series of memos of me trying to use LXC/LXD and INCUS on Debian 12 (`bookworm`).

## What is LXD and Incus

It has been some time since [Container with LXC/LXD (1)]({{< ref "note-00050.md" >}}).
* Upstream [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) (0.6 released 2024-02-23) is at https://github.com/lxc/incus by linuxcontainers.org
  * "[Incus 0.6 has been released](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/incus-0-6-has-been-released/19134)" announcement gives explanations on technical changes.
    * The command name has been changed to `incus`.
    * [コンテナと仮想マシンのマネージャ"Incus" (Japanese)](https://gihyo.jp/article/2024/01/linux_containers-0055) also gives a nice overview.
* Incus is available for Debian 12 from [Zabbly package repository](https://github.com/zabbly/incus).
  * APT setup is at [Zabbly package repository](https://github.com/zabbly/incus) as README.md.
  * [First steps with Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/tutorial/first_steps/) -- `incus-admin` group allows full control over Incus.

Now, I decided to purge LXD and try Incus on Debian 12.

## Installation of Incus to Debian 12

On a Debian 12 system with its `/var/lib` on btrfs, I run following commands to
install Incus.

```console
 ... setup APT
 $ sudo aptitude install incus incus-ui-canonical
 $ sudo adduser osamu incus-admin
 $ poweroff
...
 $ incus admin init --minimal
  ... go with defaults
```

This seems to create the `/var/lib/incus/images/` directory.

## Tracing "First steps with Incus"

I traced
"[First steps with Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/tutorial/first_steps/)".


### Getting system images for Incus

Since manpage for `incus` is missing, let's see:

```console
 $ incus launch -h
Description:
  Create and start instances from images

Usage:
  incus launch [<remote>:]<image> [<remote>:][<name>] [flags]
...
```

Full list of `remote` is available by:.

```console
 $ incus remote list
+-----------------+------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
|      NAME       |                URL                 |   PROTOCOL    |  AUTH TYPE  | PUBLIC | STATIC | GLOBAL |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
| images          | https://images.linuxcontainers.org | simplestreams | none        | YES    | NO     | NO     |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
| local (current) | unix://                            | incus         | file access | NO     | YES    | NO     |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
```

Let me create and start instances from images for "Ubuntu 22.04" and "Debian 12".

```console
 $ incus launch images:ubuntu/22.04 u1
 $ incus launch images:debian/12 d1
```

System images specified as `images:ubuntu/22.04` or `images:debian/12` are downloaded
to `/var/lib/incus/images/`.  Each of these seems to be made of 2 files.  One for
rootfs and another for templates(?) sharing the same hash value as a part of
their file name. These images seems to be offered in a squashfs. The hash
values are listed by `incus images ls`.  The same hash values are used for the
directory name under `/var/lib/lxd/storage-pools/default/images/` too.

The first invocation of `incus launch` for an image seems to download it while
its subsequent invocations seems to use the previously downloaded corresponding
image.

Local instance names are `u1` and `d1` here.   They seem to be
created under `/var/lib/incus/containers/`.  These instance names are listed by
`incus ls` and also used for the directory name under
`/var/lib/incus/storage-pools/default/containers`

Here:`incus launch ...` = `incus init ...` + `incus start ...`

### Inspect instances

Let me inspect instances.

```console
 $ incus list
+------+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
| NAME |  STATE  | IPV4 |                     IPV6                     |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+------+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
| d1   | RUNNING |      | fd42:4c3b:8e2d:60d:216:3eff:fe19:8160 (eth0) | CONTAINER | 0         |
+------+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
| u1   | RUNNING |      | fd42:4c3b:8e2d:60d:216:3eff:fe1e:7fb7 (eth0) | CONTAINER | 0         |
+------+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
```
Let me stop these instances, and inspect them:

```console
 $ incus stop d1
 $ incus stop u1
 $ incus list
+------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+
| NAME |  STATE  | IPV4 | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+
| d1   | STOPPED |      |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+
| u1   | STOPPED |      |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+------+---------+------+------+-----------+-----------+

```

So far, no difference from LXD except for the command name being changed from
`lxc` to `incus` and image repository to use.

## Access container

```console
 $ incus start d1
 $ incus exec d1 -- bash
 root@d1:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
 root@d1:~# adduser osamu
 ... ^D
```

Let's login:

```console
 $ incus console d1
To detach from the console, press: <ctrl>+a q

d1 login: osamu
Password:
Linux d1 6.5.0-0.deb12.4-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.5.10-1~bpo12+1 (2023-11-23) x86_64

osamu@d1:~$ id

 ...
```

This looked like the weird group ID issue has been resolved in the upstream
image.  But as I checked closely, the image I downloaded is non-cloud image
`images:debian/12` without any user setup.  Cloud image
`images:debian/12/cloud` still seems to suffer the same problem.

## Getting IPv4 working with `firewalld`

I have enabled a firewall system for my workstation based on `firewalld`

I configure my system with its GUI `firewall-config` as follows:

* Connection `incusbr0` has to be in the `trusted` zone instead of `public` zone.
* `public` zone has to be set to "Masquerade zone".

## `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`

Although non essential, I have removed 2nd normal user and updated
`/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` as follows:

```
root:1000:1
osamu:100000:65536
root:1000000:1000000000
```

## Summary of transition from `lxc ...` commands to `incus ...` commands

* Becoming `incus-admin` group member now allows a user to perform all activities.
* `lxd init` transition from `lxc ...` commands to `incus ...` commands now `incus admin init`.
* All other `lxc ...` commands are `incus ...`.
* The main remote repository to use is `images:` provided by https://linuxcontainers.org/ only (No more `ubuntu:`).
* Update firewall configuration with IP masquerade for IPv4.
