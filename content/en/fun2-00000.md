This "Fun to Program" was originally created around 2013 when I was learning
programming on Debian system and was published to
http://people.debian.org/~osamu/fun2prog.html .

Since this has been neglected and I thought it is good idea to go through this
content again. I moved this content to the currently maintained site
https://osamuaoki.github.io/ in 2021.

Script examples were created in 2013.  So they may not be applicable for
current system.  Also conversion was done with a simple script and minimal
manual edits, internal links may not work until they are updated manually.

In order to make it easy to trace, I am tagging all related pages under
[fun2prog](/tags/fun2prog/).

## What this is

Please consider this as a *note of a self-study student*.

This is not mean to be a tutorial document to explain how to program
nor authoritative document by an expert.

I recorded how I tried to learn programing basics of the modern large software
packages written in mixed languages using various complicated libraries. I
provide the followings:

* Learning records of my programing and building binaries.
* URL links to the essential technical information for learning.
* Minimal explanation and many simple examples.
* Some summary list of things to remember.
* Priority on POSIX shell, Python, and C. (on Debian system)

I hope this information is useful to others.

If the tailing parts of terminal example lines are dropped to fit within 80
character/line, they are indicated by `...` at the end of the line. (Or, I
forced them to fit using `fold` command.)

My local user name on this machine is `osamu`.  You may need to replace it with
your user name.

Please be careful about the publication date of reference documents since the
software infrastructure is a moving target and such documentations may be
obsoleted when you read this document.

TIP: If you find any questionable contents in this document, doubt them.  If
you find errors, let me know.

### Background

To be a Debian developer, I encounter situations to deal with large software
packages written in a combination of languages such as C, C++, Vala, Python,
Perl, Shell, LaTex, DocBook, ... with specialty cross platform build script
generators such as autotools and cmake.  Their build tools invoke commands such
as `./configure`, `make`, `gcc`, and `g++`.  These software packages tend to be
linked to many libraries which make them even more complex.

For example:

* GNOME: `gcc` + Glib + GTK+ + D-bus + Autoconf + Automake + Autopoint + ...
* KDE: MOC (Metaobject compiler) + `g++` + Qt (QtCore, QtGui, ...) + D-bus + Cmake + ...

Even with all these complexities, using these software package just for
backporting is not usually out-of-reach for me as a novice programmer with the
help of well designed packaging tools such as debhelper.  The package build
script can be deceptively simple as the following.

```
%:
	dh $@
```

But when I need to tweak something, I get overwhelmed with the complexity.  I
felt I have to practice program building and packaging with simpler case to
understand its fundamentals and to become a better Debian developer.

Also, being a maintainer, it is essential to know how debugger works to use it effectively.

There are new major technical challenges such as multitarch and fortify of
binary packages which I did not deal in "Debian New Maintainers' Guide".  These
needed to be addressed for newer packages, too.
