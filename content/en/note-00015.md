## Example: Static simple widgets into GUI

Dividing area into smaller subdivided areas are mostly done by
[GtkBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Box.html)
or
[GtkGrid](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Grid.html)
under the "Containers" button.

As a starter, I put
[GtkBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Box.html).

Then I placed 2 simple "Control" widgets and a simple __GtkLabel__
"Display" widget as an easy starter:
* [GtkButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Button.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkEntry](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Entry.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkLabel](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Label.html) under the "Display" button

I set IDs for these widgets basically by dropping "Gtk" from the GTk class
names.  Then set up signal handlers in the right panel.

| ID/Class name     | Widget               | Signal            | Signal handler  |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| simple1           | GtkWindow            | destroy           | onDestroy       |
| button            | GtkButton            | pressed           | onButtonPressed |
| entry             | GtkEntry             | changed           | onEntryChanged  |
| label             | GtkLabel             | ---               |  ---              |

Then Glade screen looks like:

## How to create a simple GUI program

Now we are ready to use this from `simple1.py`:

{{< snippet "examples/glade/simple1.py" >}}

The meaning of "@..." is described in [Decorator in PEP 318](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/).

Running this with `python3 simple1.py` will start the GUI as:

![Run simple1](/img/simple1-py.png)

Please play with this GUI while looking at your terminal outputs.

Here, I am using the signal handler which uses the call back functions which set
class variables in this example code.  Now the rationale to use the class which
generates functions and associated data is clear to me.  It is a good start but
this is not sufficient experience to make useful GUI since we still lack
examples to use "Control" and "Display" widgets.

## How Glade generated XML looks

Just in case I forget which items were selected via Glade session, here is the
Glade generated XML `simple1.ui`:
