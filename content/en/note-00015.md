## How to fill more control widgets into GUI

To put more widgets,"Number of items" on the left panel of
[GtkBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Box.html)
was incremented.  Some box are further subdivided again with
[GtkBox](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Box.html)
with their "Orientation" settings set to "Horizontal" instead.

Then I placed several additional simple "Control" widgets:
* [GtkSpinButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/SpinButton.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkToggleButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ToggleButton.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkCheckButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/CheckButton.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkRadioButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/RadioButton.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkFileChooserButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/FileChooserButton.html) under the "Control" button

Please note I created multiple widgets to learn how they work together with
the object.

I set IDs for these widgets basically by dropping "Gtk" from the GTk class
names with optional number as suffix to distinguish them.  Then set up signal
handlers in the right panel.

| ID/Class name     | Widget               | Signal            | Signal handler  |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Simple            | GtkWindow            | destroy           | onDestroy       |
| Button            | GtkButton            | pressed           | onButtonPressed |
| Entry             | GtkEntry             | changed           | onEntryChanged  |
| SpinButton?       | GtkSpinButton        | changed           | onSpinButtonChanged? |
| ToggleButton?     | GtkToggleButton      | toggled           | onToggleButtonToggled? |
| CheckButton?      | GtkCheckButton       | toggled           | onCheckButtonToggled? |
| RadioButton?      | GtkRadioButton       | toggled           | onRadioButtonToggled |
| FileChooserButton | GtkFileChooserButton | selection-changed | onFileChooserButtonChanged |
| Label             | GtkLabel             | ---               |  ---              |

There are some non-obvious extra works other with Glade usage.

[GtkSpinButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/SpinButton.html)
widget needs to click on the pen-icon in the "Adjustment" entry box to open
dialog and create a new __Adjustment__ object "adjustment1" for __SpinButton1__.
Although normally each __SpinButton?__ has its own adjustment?", just for
learning, let me set the same __Adjustment__ object "adjustment1" for
__SpinButton2__.  These 2 spin buttons now function in parallel since they
share the same __Adjustment__ object "adjustment1".

[GtkToggleButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ToggleButton.html)
widget can display icon instead of just a text label by clicking "Always show
image" checkbox and clicking on the pen-icon in the "Image" entry box to open
dialog and create a new __GtkImage__ object "image1" for __ToggleButton1__.
When setting "Image", somehow my Glade focus on deprecated "Stock ID".  Just
click radio button for "Icon name" and select one you like.  Do the same for
another to create a new __GtkImage__ object "image2".  If you put null string
to the text label, this becomes a clean small icon button.

[GtkCheckButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/CheckButton.html)
widget is very much like
[GtkToggleButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/ToggleButton.html)
except for presentation of its state and area to click.

[GtkRadioButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/RadioButton.html)
widget with round icon is visually very much like
[GtkCheckButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/CheckButton.html)
with square icon but has quite unique feature of exclusivity.  This is realized
by grouping these controls.  Click on the pen-icon in the "Group" entry box for
RadioButton2 and RadioButton3 widgets and select RadioButton1 as their Group
choice.

[GtkFileChooserButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/FileChooserButton.html)
widget has 2 modes of operations determined by "FileChooserAttribute" to be
either "Open" or "Select Folder".  Let's set this to "Select Folder".  (Somehow
my Glade version 3.38.2 tends to skip updating menu.  So I end up setting it
multiple times and checking the resulting XML file for `<property
name="action">select-folder</property>` with a text editor.)

### How to create GUI program

Now we are ready to use this from `simple2.py`:

{{< snippet "examples/glade/simple2.py" >}}

Running this with `python3 simple2.py` will start the GUI as:

## How Glade generated XML looks

Just in case I forget which items were selected via Glade session, here is the
Glade generated XML `simple2.ui`:
