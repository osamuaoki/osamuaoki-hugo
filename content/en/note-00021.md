## Example: Multiline Text Editor with GtkSource.View

Next exercise is to create a modal dialog window with Glade similar to [Multiline Text Editor](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textview.html)

Doing this with the
[Gtk.TextView](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/TextView.html)
widget is not so challenging. I decided to use
[GtkSource.View](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/GtkSource-3.0/classes/View.html)
instead to gain access to capability of regex and case sensitivity.

I didn't see __GtkSource.View__ related widgets in the Glade's available choice list, I first created Multiline Text Editor with __Gtk.TextView__ just to get the general design done.
Since we have 2 toplevel widgets, 2 XML files were created by Glade to allow us to use
[Gtk.Template](htt__GtkSource.View__ps://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/gtk_template.html).

Then I removed __Gtk.TextView__ and  __Gtk.TextBuffer__ from Glade and left
empty container and wrote code in Python which uses __GtkSource.View__ and
attach it to empty container with `self.scrollwin.add(self.textview)`.

In order to [get proper response](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Dialog.html#Gtk.Dialog.run)
upon exiting from `dialog.run()`, I enabled __Response ID__ for buttons in modal window using Glade.  (It was not so obvious for me.)

Since this program uses UTF-8 text, this program can handle Japanese and French, too.

The resulting code is long as below but it is relatively easy to reconfigure its graphic components using Glade.
