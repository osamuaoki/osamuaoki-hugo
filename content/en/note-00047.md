Since I didn't find GNOME shell extension to provide shortcuts to input method
activations, I decided to create one by following examples of existing
extensions without rigorous learning.  I also worked on quick touchpad control.
See my final result at:

- [Quick switching of input method and touchpad](https://github.com/osamuaoki/inputmethod-shortcuts)

I also updated [GNOME extensions for better UX]({{<ref note-00045.md>}}).

## Simple GNOME shell extension

One can create a skelton of a simple GNOME shell extension as:
```sh
$ gnome-shell-extension-tool --create-extension
```

This created a almost empty GNOME shell extension under
`~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`.

After "Log out" and "Log in" to my account, this GNOME shell extension can be
seen from "Extensions".  But this was too simple to do anything useful.

## Reference examples

Since I had no idea how to set up keybindings for switching input methods, I
looked around examples on simple GNOME extensions with "shortcut" as a keyword.

### GNOME extension "Shortcuts"

GNOME extension [Shortcuts](https://gitlab.com/paddatrapper/shortcuts-gnome-extension)
looked like simple enough since all it does is toggling of display when `<Super>s` is pressed.

But there is no text like `super` in the source.  It looks like `imports.ui.main.overview` gets a call back to enable toggling of display.

```javascript
const Main = imports.ui.main;
...
  Main.overview._specialToggle = function (evt) {
    _toggleShortcuts();
  };
```

`gnome-shell` source has `js/ui/main.js` which calls `overview.init()` then `js/ui/overviw.js` which has `overview.init()` calling:

```javascript
const Main = imports.ui.main;
...
Main.wm.addKeybinding(
    'toggle-overview',
    new Gio.Settings({ schema_id: WindowManager.SHELL_KEYBINDINGS_SCHEMA }),
    Meta.KeyBindingFlags.IGNORE_AUTOREPEAT,
    Shell.ActionMode.NORMAL | Shell.ActionMode.OVERVIEW,
    this.toggle.bind(this));
```

In `data/org.gnome.shell.gschema.xml.in` from `gnome-shell` source, I found:

```xml
<key name="toggle-overview" type="as">
│ <default>["&lt;Super&gt;s"]</default>
│ <summary>Keybinding to open the overview</summary>
│ <description>
│ │ Keybinding to open the Activities Overview.
│ </description>
</key>
```
So basically, this extension uses keybinding defined by `gnome-shell`.

The schema definition `<default>["&lt;Super&gt;s"]</default>` used in
`data/org.gnome.shell.gschema.xml.in` is interesting. Also,
`imports.ui.main.wm.addKeybinding()` seems to be the way to bind specific key
to a JavaScript code.

I also got idea to use **IGNORE_AUTOREPEAT** from this.

### GNOME extension "More keyboard shortcuts"

[More keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/matthijskooijman/gnome-shell-more-keyboard-shortcuts)
also looked like simple enough since all it does is
switching window on the current workspace
when `<Super>j`  or `<Super>k` is pressed.

This source has its own `schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.more-keyboard-shortcuts.gschema.xml` with `<default><![CDATA[['<Super>j']]]></default>` and `<default><![CDATA[['<Super>k']]]></default>` for `<key type="as" name="switch-window-next-workspace">` and `<key type="as" name="switch-window-prev-workspace">`.

I suppose this `CDATA` thing is the same thing as `<default>["&lt;Super&gt;j"]</default>` and `<default>["&lt;Super&gt;k"]</default>`.

I also see `extension.js` has the following which binds "key name" to JavaScript.

```javascript
function enable() {
    Main.wm.addKeybinding("switch-window-next-workspace",
        settings,
        Meta.KeyBindingFlags.NONE,
        Shell.ActionMode ? Shell.ActionMode.NORMAL : Shell.KeyBindingMode.NORMAL,
        function(display, screen, window, binding) {
            switchWindow(true);
        }
    );
    Main.wm.addKeybinding("switch-window-prev-workspace",
        settings,
        Meta.KeyBindingFlags.NONE,
        Shell.ActionMode ? Shell.ActionMode.NORMAL : Shell.KeyBindingMode.NORMAL,
        function(display, screen, window, binding) {
            switchWindow(false);
        }
    );
}
```

By replacing `switchWindow()` with Input Method setting JavaScript function, I
think I can get desired extension functionality.

Since this was my first JavaScript program, there were many rough edges.

## Initial working GNOME shell extension for switching input methods

I then went to upload a zip file of this newly made extension to GNOME site.
It became very interesting learning experiences.

### `inputmethod-shortcuts` (v1: rejected)

**JustPerfection** gave me feed backs.

```text
OsamuAoki's extension, "Shortcuts to activate input methods", version 1 has a new review:

JustPerfection posted a review on June 25, 2023:

1. Please remove `stylesheet.css` since you are not using it:
    https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html#don-t-include-unnecessary-files

2. Remove versions &gt;=45 since we don&#x27;t have those versions yet.

3. Use initTranslations() and getSettings() from ExtensionUtils instead of creating your own custom functions (remove convenience.js after that):
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/blob/main/js/misc/extensionUtils.js

4. That&#x27;s too much for init (line 42 extension.js):
    https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html#only-use-init-for-initialization

    Move that line to enable and null that out in disable:
    https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html#destroy-all-objects

5. Remove all the key bindings on disable (line 118-149 extension.js).

If you need any help with your extension you can ask us on:
- [GNOME Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#extensions:gnome.org)
- IRC Bridge: irc://irc.gimpnet.org/shell-extensions

Please use the review page to follow up:

https://extensions.gnome.org/review/42618
```
This was very helpful.  I thought I fixed them all but (I forgot to erase old
zip in the source tree.)  I uploaded again.

### `inputmethod-shortcuts` (v2: rejected)

```text
OsamuAoki's extension, "Shortcuts to activate input methods", version 2 has a new review:

JustPerfection posted a review on June 25, 2023:

1. You forgot to remove `stylesheet.css` and `convenience.js`.
2. As I said before, you should null out `settings` in disable.
3. I recommend to Import in top of the code instead of inside enable (line 51, 60, 69 and 78 extension.js).

Please use the review page to follow up:

Very kind words on careless newbie.

### `inputmethod-shortcuts` (v3: rejected)

I missed issue 2 pointed out for version 2.  So I uploaded another one before
getting official rejection.

### `inputmethod-shortcuts` (v4: accepted)

This got accepted.  (I saw some minor issues and fixed them in git repo,
later.)

## Further improvements of GNOME extension `inputmethod-shortcuts` (v5 ... v11 ...)

I explored more refactoring of code and feature additions to support
shortcut configuration.

### Use of ES6 **class**-syntax

Both ES5 prototype-syntax and ES6 class-syntax offer OOP features, but ES6
class-syntax is less confusing for me.  So I decided to rewite
`inputmethod-shortcuts` using ES6 class-syntax.  -- done

### Use for-loop

Repeating codes looks stupid.  So I added for-loop. -- done

### Add prefs.js

Make shortcut key choice configurable. -- done

### Get IM settings

Use `Gio` -> `Settings` -- done

So IM names are displayed and their shortcuts are configurable up to 10.

### Control touchpad `enabled` / `disabled`

Since the following shell code lines turn on/off touchpad:
```sh
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events enabled
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events disabled
```

I tried the same thing in `gjs-console`:
```javascript
gjs> Touchpad = new imports.gi.Gio.Settings({ schema_id: 'org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad' })
[object instance wrapper GIName:Gio.Settings jsobj@0x36b95d5f5b8 native@0x7fee6000fc60]
gjs> Touchpad.get_value("send-events")
[object variant of type "s"]
gjs> Touchpad.get_string("send-events")
"disabled"
gjs> Touchpad.set_string("send-events", "enabled")
true
gjs> Touchpad.set_string("send-events", "disabled")
true
```
I refactored `prefs.js` and added touchpad control shortcuts.

NOTE: Media key for touchpad seems to cause pop-up icons displayed without
changes to the touchpad state.
(schema=`org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys`, key=`touchpad-on`)

### Input Method Shortcuts (example screenshot)

![Pref - InputMethods](/img/pref-inputmethods.png)

Here, I disabled `<Super>Space` and `<Super><Shift>Space` usages in "Settings"
-> "Keyboard" -> "Keyboard shortcuts" -> "Typing" before setting up as above.

### Touchpad Shortcuts (example screenshot)

![Pref - Touchpad](/img/pref-touchpad.png)

### `xkb=ru` interference fix


Normal ibus-based input methods break when they are invoked after using
`xkb=ru`.  In order to reduce shortcut key presses, I added feature to go
through the primary xkb before invoking any ibus.

### Learning JavaScript for GJS

When I started to write GJS JavaScript code for this extension, I had no idea
on JavaScript except it is a interpreter with C/C\+\+-like syntax. Here is a
list of reference documents I decided to read to understand JavaScript and its
use for GNOME.

- Wikipedia: [JavaScript](s://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- Wikipedia: [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
- MDN: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [A Guide to JavaScript for GNOME](https://gjs.guide/)
  - [Developer Guides](https://gjs.guide/guides/)
    - [GNOME JavaScript Introduction](https://gjs.guide/guides/gjs/intro.html)
    - [Feature Compatibility](https://gjs.guide/guides/gjs/features-across-versions.html)
    - [GJS Legacy Class Syntax](https://gjs.guide/guides/gjs/legacy-class-syntax.html)
    - [GJS Style Guide](https://gjs.guide/guides/gjs/style-guide.html)
  - [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://gjs.guide/extensions/)
  - [JavaScript reference](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/javascript/)

JavaScript versions were confusing to me.  Major versions are:
- ES5: ECMAScript 5 (2009)
- ES6: ECMAScript 6 (2015)

I also find a nice summary of generic style equivalences of ES5 and ES6 at
[w3schools.com site for JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp).

### Tip: Checking systemd log

I can see all **gnome-shell** log including DEBUG output from the last system
boot as:

```sh
$ journalctl -p 7 -b -g gnome-shell
```

- Use `-g gjs` for `prefs.js`.
- Use `-f` instead of `-b` to monitor continuously.
