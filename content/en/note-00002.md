Let's customize web site contents.

  1. I want to have 2 separate directories for English and Japanese contents.
  1. Main menu should have link to the list of contents dedicated for English
     and Japanese contents
  1. The list of contents needs to be customized.

The following pages gave me good starting points.

  * https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/hugo-directory-structure/
  * https://sourceforge.net/p/hugo-generator/wiki/markdown_syntax/

## Customization

Here are what I did:

* Since I don't use `content/_index.Rmarkdown`, I erased it.
* In order to save typing, I renamed `content/_index.markdown` to
`content/_index.md`.  Of course, I cleaned out most of the contents.
* Since upstream had `content/note` and `content/post`, I renamed them to
`content/en` and `content/jp`.
* The menu entries for `English` and `Japanese` are added by editing
`config.toml`.
* `content/en/_index.md` and `content/jp/_index.md` are added to customize the
list of contents.

Then create a github repository `osamuaoki-hugo` via github GUI and commit this
source for hugo.

```
 $ git add -A .
 $ git commit -m "updated webpage source"
 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:osamuaoki/osamuaoki-hugo.git
 $ git push -u origin master
```

See published source of this site at
https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamuaoki-hugo

## Publishing HTML pages

At `/path/to/<webbuildtree>`, execute `hugo` to build HTML files under
`/path/to/<webbuildtree>/publish` directory.

Then create a github repository `osamuaoki.github.io` via github GUI and commit
this generated HTML files.

```
 $ hugo
 $ cd public
 $ git init
 $ git add .
 $ git commit -m "built webpages"
 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:osamuaoki/osamuaoki.github.io.git
 $ git push -u origin master
```

This publishes web page at https://osamuaoki.github.io/

Let's use  `git submodule` to manage these 2 repositories.

```
 $ cd ..
 $ rm -rf public
 $ git submodule add git@github.com:osamuaoki/osamuaoki.github.io.git public
 $ git add .
 $ git commit -m "add submodule"
```

Here, publication of github pages is realized by committing static HTML pages
to a certain branch of a certain github repository to enable github pages.


| repository            | branch      | URL used to publish web pages           |
|:----------------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------|
| `<username>.github.io`| `master`    | `https://<username>.github.io`          |
| `<project>`           | `gh-pages`  | `https://<username>.github.io/<project>`|

## Updating webpages

```
 $ cd /path/to/<webbuildtree>/content
  ... hack source
 $ cd /path/to/<webbuildtree>
 $ git add -A .
 $ git commit -m "updated source"
 $ hugo
 $ cd publish
 $ git add -A .
 $ git commit -m "updated webpages"
 $ cd ..
 $ git commit -a -m "updated submodule for webpages"
```

## Date

Normally, hugo doesn't publish future date unless `-F` is specified.

So please consider to include `date:` to include full `date --iso=sec` output
as follows.

* Header of this page:
```
title: Initial setup for hugo (2)
date: 2019-02-09T11:15:56+09:00
categories:
  - web
  - english
tags:
  - hugo
slug: initial-setup02
```

* Header to publish anytime after the start of the day of JST.
```
date: 2019-02-09T00:00:00+09:00
```

* Header to publish anytime after the end of the day of JST.
```
date: 2019-02-09T23:59:59+09:00
```
If time zone is omitted, it seems to use UT.

## Draft

Add following to the header of the source.

```
date: 2999-12-31
draft: true
```

Check the resulting page with `hugo -F -D server` to include darft and future
dated page.
