## XML

[XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) is a representation of the textual data structure.  For example, it is used for web pages ([XHTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML)) and DocBook source files ([DocBook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook)).

The tag pair "`<tag> ... </tag>`" or selfclosing tag "`<tag />`" are used to markup the text data.  This simple XML data structure allows to create its generic data processing tools such as XSLT, DOM, SAX, ... .

### XSLT

I used [XSLT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT) (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) to manupulate DocBook XML source files for my [Debian Reference](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/).

It automated inserting popcon data and reformatted URLs suitable for [po4a](http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/) translation framework.

Its source is available at [alioth subversion repo for debian-reference](http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/ddp/manuals/trunk/quick-reference/).

My impression is, "yes we can write ... but debugging is hell and code is un-intuitive.".

So my next update of these build scripts may not use XSLT.

### Python

There are several [Python XML processing modules](http://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html) to chose from.

* [DOM](http://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.html) (generic XML parser to read a whole document first and to organoze its objects in a tree structure.)
* [Sax](http://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.html) (generic XML parser to read it sequentially with an event-driven API.)
* [ElementTree](http://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) (new easy-to-use pythonic API, now lxml is merged.)
    * `parse()` is like DOM
    * `iterparse()` is like SAX
    * Limitted [Xpath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) support (no parent node)
* ... others

When I wanted to extract the list of the [jōyō kanji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) (literally "regular-use Chinese characters") data from the [常用漢字一覧](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B8%B8%E7%94%A8%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7) page of the Japanese Wikipedia site, I chose **Elementtree** since it looked easier to program.

### Download data

Let's download target HTML page (in XHTML).

Download XML file

{{< snippet "examples/xml/et/download.log" >}}


Please note the original downloaded data was compressed.

### Find XPath to target

Since it is very awkward to count the XPath location manually, I created a text pattern to XPath conversion tool.  (This works for XML somewhat like what `grep` does for the plain text.)

Program to search XPath (search-xpath.py)


{{< snippet "examples/xml/et/search-xpath.py" >}}


Let's run this script to find the XPath to key locations having specific texts such as "一覧".

Saerching XPath

{{< snippet "examples/xml/et/search-xpath.log" >}}


### Extract data from XML

Now that we know the kanji data is under `html/body[1]/div[3]/div[3]/div[4]/table[2]/tr[*]/td[2]/a[1]` where * iterates over lines.  (This works for XML somewhat like what `sed` does for the plain text.)

Program to extract data (kanji.py)


{{< snippet "examples/xml/et/kanji.py" >}}


Let's run this script to list all Jouyou kanjis.

Lists all jouyou kanjis (trancated).

{{< snippet "examples/xml/et/kanji.log" >}}


### XML with namespace

For example, this fun2prog web page is in the typical XHTML format having namespace embedded in the "`<html>`" tag attiribute as "`<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">`".  This declaration applies to child elements until it is overriden by another definition.

In an Element tree, such qualified names are stored as universal names in Clark’s notatioion.  So if "`<tag>`" apears in such XML, Elementtree read it as:

```
{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}tag
```

For example, let's consider that a copy of this web page fun2prog.html in this current directory.  The first thing to do is to change above example code to the following.

```
..
    tree = ET.parse('jouyou.xml')
    root = tree.getroot()
..
```

Running this will produce very noisy output (folded to fit to the screen).

```
{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}html/ \
{[1](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}body)/ \
{[2](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}div)/ ...
```

The following should let you supress these curly brakets.

```
..
    f = open('fun2prog.html', 'r')
    xhtmlstring = f.read()
    f.close()
    xhtmlstring = re.sub(' xmlns="[^"]+"', '', xhtmlstring, count=1)
    root = ET.fromstring(xhtmlstring)
..
```
