Here is a memo over automatic USB backup.

This is a follow-up of "[Backup and snapshot]({{< ref "note-00028.md" >}})".

(This uses the latest `batch` and `gather` subcommand of `bss`)

`udev`(7) under "RUN" clearly states "This can only be used for very
short-running foreground tasks.".

We still see old tips such as [Automatic backups with
UDEV](https://blog.deadlypenguin.com/2009/09/25/automatic-backups-with-udev/)
(2009), which abuse "RUN" in udev rule to perform backup.  These tips shouldn't
be followed.

Under modern system managed by systemd, it seems [we need to use its systemd
service file with "wants"
mechanism](https://askubuntu.com/questions/25071/how-to-run-a-script-when-a-specific-flash-drive-is-mounted/679600#679600).
(2015-2020)

## Find out systemd service name of auto mounted USB disk

Let's suppose my backup USB drive is (auto)mounted as
`/media/osamu/BKUP_USB`.  Then, I can use `systemctl list-units -t mount|grep
BKUP_USB` to find systemd service name corresponding to
`/media/osamu/BKUP_USB`.  For example:

```console
$ systemctl list-units -t mount|grep USB
  media-osamu-BKUP_USB.mount      loaded active mounted /media/osamu/BKUP_USB
$ systemctl status media-osamu-BKUP_USB.mount
‚óè media-osamu-BKUP_USB.mount - /media/osamu/BKUP_USB
     Loaded: loaded (/proc/self/mountinfo)
     Active: active (mounted) since Wed 2024-01-03 20:32:41 JST; 14min ago
      Where: /media/osamu/BKUP_USB
       What: /dev/sda1
```

## Backup upon each mount event 

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/bss-BKUP_USB.service` as:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=USB Disk backup
Requires=media-penguin-BKUP_USB.mount
After=media-penguin-BKUP_USB.mount

[Service]
ExecStart=bss --may --type usb batch BKUP_USB

[Install]
WantedBy=media-penguin-BKUP_USB.mount
```

Create `~/.config/bss/BKUP_USB`

```sh
########################################################################
# make new backup copy (path are relative from $HOME)
# * source is a btrfs subvolume at ~/SRC_SUBVOL
#   * always ignore error from gather
# * destination is auto-mountable partition on a USB drive:
#   * formatted as btrfs and
#   * labeled as 'DST_LABEL'
########################################################################
bss_usb_backup () {
  # $1: SRC_SUBVOL
  # $2: DST_LABEL
  bss gather "$1" || true
  bss copy   "$1" "/media/$(id -un)/$2/$1" || $BSS_MAY
  bss snap        "/media/$(id -un)/$2/$1" || $BSS_MAY
  bss process     "/media/$(id -un)/$2/$1" || $BSS_MAY
}

# Backup to BKUP_USB (high frequency backup SSD device)
MSGID=$(notify-send -p "bss: BKUP_USB" "backup in progress ...")
bss_usb_backup Documents BKUP_USB
notify-send -r "$MSGID" "bss: BKUP_USB" "backup finished!"

# vim:se sw=2 ts=2 sts=2 et ai tw=78:
```

Please note use of `notify-send` in this script.

Then, activate this service unit as:

```console
 $ systemctl --user enable bss-BKUP_USB.service
```

Somehow, I get the following unexpected spurious yellow warning.

```console
Unit /home/penguin/.config/systemd/user/bss-BKUP_USB.service is added as a dependency to a non-existent unit media-penguin-BKUP_USB.mount.
```

Despite this warning, USB storage seems to be getting backup data when my workstation is powered up with USB drive plugged-in or when it get plugged-in.

## `bss gather ...`

The `bss gather` subcommand was introduced as an alternative tool to enable
secure remote backups when `luksimg` was dropped.  In March 2024, `bss gather`
changed its configuration file format.  Now it uses "FILTER RULES" of
`rsync`(1).

For gather configuration file `.gather.rc`, `bss gather` executes `rsync` with
the following (excluding details):

```console
 $ rsync -a --filter=". .gather.rc" $srcdir $destdir
```

The syntax of gather configuration file is defined in the "FILTER RULES" in
`rsync`(1) manpage.

Although this gather configuration file can be written in any order, I usually
organize this file in the following order.

* Partial path exclusion match rules to be forced
  * file name match rule (e.g. "`- *~`" without "`/`")
  * dir name match rule (e.g., "`- .git/`" with only one "`/`" at the end)
* Full path inclusion match rules (pattern starts with "`/`")
  * the parent3 dir inclusion match rule (e.g., "`+ /a/`" with "`/`" at the end)
  * the parent2 dir inclusion match rule (e.g., "`+ /a/b/`" with "`/`" at the end)
  * the parent1 dir inclusion match rule (e.g., "`+ /a/b/c/`" with "`/`" at the end)
  * the target inclusion match rule (no "`/`" at the end)
    * inclusion match rule for individual target file (e.g., "`+ /a/b/c/targetfile`")
    * recursive inclusion match rule for files under target dir (e.g., "`+ /a/b/c/targetdir/***`")
* Full path fall-back all-exclusion match rule (e.g., "`- /***`")

For example, configuration for home directory looks like:

```
# Force exclude always for partial match (dir)
- .git/
- .bss.d/
# Force exclude always for partial match (file)
- *~
- core
# Pull path match for files in the base path
+ /.bashrc
+ /.devscripts
+ /.editorconfig
+ /.face
+ /.face.icon
+ /.gbp.conf
+ /.gitconfig
+ /.profile
+ /.pycodestyle
+ /.reportbugrc
+ /.sbuildrc
+ /.shellcheckrc
+ /.vimrc
# Pull path match for recursive include -- match parent dir path first
+ /.config/
+ /.config/autostart/***
+ /.config/black/***
+ /.config/bss/***
+ /.config/flake8/***
+ /.config/kitty/***
+ /.config/pylint/***
+ /.config/systemd/***
+ /.config/nvim/***
+ /.gnupg/***
+ /.ssh/***
+ /.local/
+ /.local/share/
+ /.local/share/keyrings/***
+ /.sbuildrc.d/***
+ /.bashrc.d/***
+ /bin/***
# Drop files and directory not included explicitly in the above
- /***
```

The use of `***` (available for recent `rsync`) makes it easy to write rule.

The above execution is actually over-simplified.  In reality, details are taken
care to avoid gathering snapshot files under the `.bss.d/` directory as:

```console
 $ rsync -aHS --delete-excluded --mkpath --filter="- .bss.d/" \
              --filter=". .gather.rc" $srcdir $destdir
```
