## Python program

[Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is a vary
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language[high-level
programming language] which offers features to support
[OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).  It is very well
documented in the [Python documentation web site](http://docs.python.org/).

Python frees us from chores of the memory management required by C and allows
us to focus on the problem solving.  Python module system allows us to organize
codes in multiple files nicely and let us divide and conqueror bugs
efficiently.

If you are completely new to Python, I found a wiki page at
[DebianWomen/PythonTutorial](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen/PythonTutorial)
to be a very good starting point.  (I knew Python basics explained here.)

Let me try to learn slightly advanced Python such as modules and class by going
through the following available documentation as the self-teaching session.

* [The Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) (Complete tutorial)
* [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B. Downey
* [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python!](https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* Wikipedia articles

Consider the following as my note of the self-teaching session.

TIP: If you are using Python 2.7, replace `python3` in the above examples with `python`.

### What is OOP?

An [object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) is a
*location in memory* having a
[value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) and referenced by
an [identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier). An object can be a
[variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)),
[function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine), or
[data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming[Object-oriented
programming (OOP)] is a
[programming paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).  The
"object" for OOP refers to a particular
[instance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) of a
[class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)). Objects are used
to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.
"[objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science))" have

* [data fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science)) (attributes that describe the object) and
* associated procedures known as [methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science)).

### Python2 and Python3

See ["Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?"](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)

Currently, Python is available in 2 major versions.

Python2
* Very stable (2.7 being the last version)
* Very robust
* Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding centric

Python3
* Future of Python
* Moving target
* Cleaner grammer
    * `print` as a function.
    * extensive use of iterator
* UTF-8 encoding centric

The conversion of source files between Python2 and Python3 is done by:

* [2to3](http://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html)
* [3to2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2)

<!--  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2 -->

Example to convert Python2 to Python3 using `fridge.py` in [Python inheritance](#python-inheritance)

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-2to3.log" >}}


References:
* ["Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3" in "Python HOWTOs."](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html)
* ["What’s New In Python 3.0"](http://docs.python.org/release/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html)

### Python modules

See ["The Python Tutorial: Modules"](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html).

The Python *module* is a block of reusable code which can be *imported* to some
Python code.

Types of modules:
* pure Python module
    * a module written in Python and contained in a `.py` file.
* extension module
    * a module written in the low-level language of the Python implementation: C/C++ for Python in a `.so` file.
    * extension module written in C is a shared library following [Python/C API](http://docs.python.org/3/c-api/).
* module package
    * a module package contains many modules under a tree of directories all containing `__init__.py` files.

Names defined by the Python module:
* Names defined by the current module is listed by the Python built-in function [`dir()`](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-dir-function).
* Names defined by the `foo` module is listed by the Python built-in function [`dir(foo)`](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-dir-function).

Python module search path:
* Python module search path is used to search Python modules by the `import` statement.
    * "`import foo`" imports the Python code `foo.py` found in the Python module search path.
    * "`import foo`" imports the compiled C code `foo.so` found in the Python module search path.
* Python module search path is defined in the Python variable `sys.path`.
* Python module search path is usually customized by the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable by the user.

Let's check it with the `printpath2` script for Python 2.*.

Program to check `sys.path` for Python 2.*


{{< snippet "examples/python/path/printpath2" >}}


The console output is:

`sys.path` for Python 2.*

{{< snippet "examples/python/path/printpath2.log" >}}


Let's check it with the `printpath3` script for Python 3.*.

Program to check `sys.path` for Python 3.*


{{< snippet "examples/python/path/printpath3" >}}


The console output is:

`sys.path` for Python 3.*

{{< snippet "examples/python/path/printpath3.log" >}}


The Python module search path is set as follows:

* The directory containing the input script.
    * The current working directory for interactive `python`.
* `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
    * colon (":") separated on Unix-like systems (defined in `.bashrc` etc.)
    * semicolon (";") separated on the Windows system
* The installation-dependent default.
    * `/usr/lib/python*.*`
    * `/usr/lib/python*.*/plat-linux*`
    * `/usr/lib/python*.*/lib-dynload`
    * `/home/<user_name>/.local/lib/python*.*/site-packages` (installed by the local user.)
    * `/usr/local/lib/python*.*/dist-packages` (installed by the local admin.)
    * `/usr/lib/python*/dist-packages` (installed by the Debian system.)
* The content of any `*.pth` files (if present)
    * `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PIL.pth` containing `PIL` to include `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PIL`. (Python 2)
    * ...

TIP: The additional Python module search path including `dist-packages` are for modules provided by the Debian system.

The `sys.path` value consists of only existing directory path on the system.  (I.e., `/home/<user_name>/.local/lib/python3.2/site-packages` should exist to see it in the above example.)

* ["Debian Python Policy": "Module Path"](http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/ch-python.html#s-paths).
* ["Debian Python Policy": "Debian packaged modules"](http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/ch-module_packages.html).

### Python module package

See ["The Python Tutorial: Python module package."](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)

Python module files may be organized in multi-level directories.
For example on Unix-like environments, a Python module package `foo` may
contain directories and files as follows:

```
foo/
    __init__.py
    bar.py
    baz/
        __init__.py
        qux.py
```

* `foo/` should reside in the Python module search path `sys.path`.
* All directories in the Python module package should contain `__init__.py`.
* The module name uses the platform independent "dotted module name" convention.
    * The module name `foo` accesses the module file `foo/__init__.py`.
    * The module name `foo.bar` accesses the module file `foo/bar.py`.
    * The module name `foo.baz` accesses the module file `foo/baz/__init__.py`.
    * The module name `foo.baz.qux` accesses the module file `foo/baz/qux.py`.
* "`import foo`" imports the entire Python module package `foo` including all submodules.
* The Python module `*.py` in the above may alternatively be the shared libraries `*.so` following [Python/C API](http://docs.python.org/3/c-api/)

### Python scope

See ["The Python Tutorial: Python Scopes and Namespaces."](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces)

A *scope* is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is *directly accessible* by the unqualified reference to a name.  It is determined textually no matter from where or by what alias the function is called.

The *name searching order* is the following:

* the *local* names in the innermost scope
* the *non-local* names in the nearest enclosing scope (excluding the last 2 scopes)
* the *global* names in the next-to-last scope
* the *built-in* names in the outermost scope.

The *name binding scope* can be manipulated.

* The nonlocal statement rebinds variables as the non-local names.
* The global statement rebinds variables as the global names.
* The del statement removes the binding of the local variables.

Here is an example of code to show scopes and namespaces: `test_scope`.



{{< snippet "examples/python/scope/test_scope" >}}


This is a bit more complicated than the [example found on Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#scopes-and-namespaces-example) since this [handles exceptions](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions) caused by the errors.

Let's execute this.


{{< snippet "examples/python/scope/test_scope.log" >}}


### Python class

See ["The Python Tutorial: A First Look at Classes."](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes)

When a *class definition* is left normally (via the end), a *class object* is created.  Class object for `MyClass` has attributes such as `foo` and `bar` globally referenced as `MyClass.foo` and `MyClass.bar`.

By the assignment of a class object, a new *instance object* such as `x` is created.  *Instance objects* can have 2 types of valid attributes:  *data attribute* and *method attribute*.  They may be referenced as `x.foo` and `x.bar`.

The *data attribute* in Python is equivalent of *instance variables* in [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) and *data members* in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\+\+[C++].

*Data attributes* override *method attributes* and may cause confusion.  There are some naming conventions to prevent this confusion.

* *data attribute* names
    * prefix with a underscore
    * using nouns
* *method attribute* names
    * capitalize
    * using verbs

The first argument of a method is called `self` by convention.

An object has class (also called its type) which is stored as `object.__class__`.

The instantiation method is defined by `def __init__(self):` etc.

### Python inheritance

See ["The Python Tutorial: Inheritance."](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)

The syntax for the derived class definition starts with:

* `class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):`
* `class DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):`

Derived classes may override methods of their base classes. (I.e., All methods in Python are effectively [virtual methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_function) in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\+\+[C++] sense.)

A base class accessible as `BaseClassName` may be extended by calling its method directly as `BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)`.

Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:

* `isinstance()`
    * `isinstance(obj, int)` is True only if `obj.__class__` for the `obj` instance is `int` or some class derived from `int`.
* `issubclass()`
    * issubclass(bool, int) is True since `bool` is a subclass of `int`.
    * issubclass(float, int) is False since `float` is not a subclass of `int`.

Python supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this:

The syntax for the multiple inheritance starts with:

* `class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):`

The attributes inherited from a parent class is searched basically as:

* depth-first
* left-to-right
* not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hierarchy.

Thus, the search order is:

* attributes found in `DerivedClassName`
* attributes found in `Base1` class
* attributes found in recursively in the base classes of `Base1`
* attributes found in `Base2` class
* ...

In practice, slightly more complex method resolution order like the call-next-method of [CLOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System) is supported via cooperative calls to the [super](http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#super) built-in function. (This is out-of-scope for me now.)

Here is an example of code `fridge/fridge.py` in Python2 to show how class and inheritance can be used.



{{< snippet "examples/python/package1/fridge/fridge.py" >}}


Let's execute this.


{{< snippet "examples/python/package1/fridge-py.log" >}}


Here is an example of code `fridge/fridge.py` in Python3 converted from the above example by `2to3` as described in [Python2 and Python3](#python2_and_python3).


{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge/fridge.py" >}}


Let's execute this.


{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-py.log" >}}


### Python private variables

See ["The Python Tutorial: Private Variables."](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables)

*Private* instance variables that should be treated as a non-public part of the API normally use names prefixed with an underscore (e.g. `_spam`) by convention.

The name mangling mechanism to support class-private members:

* For current class name of `classname` or `_classname`:
    * Replace `__spam` with `_classname__spam`.
    * Replace `__spam_` with `_classname__spam_`.

### Install Python source distribution

See http://docs.python.org/3/install/["The Python Tutorial: Installing Python
Modules"] to learn `distutils` from user's perspective.

Python programs are normally distributed as a tar ball containing Python module
package and script files.  These are managed by the cross-platform distribution
utility, `distutils`.  The Python source distribution tar ball can be untared
as:

```
setup.py
foo/
    __init__.py
    bar.py
    baz/
        __init__.py
        qux.py
scripts/
    command_line_command
```

The `setup.py` script of `distutils` installs Python module package `foo` in this Python source distribution to the `lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` subdirectory with:

Basic install (system wide to `/usr/local`)
```
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Alternate install (per user to `~/.local`)
```
$ pythone setup.py install --user
```

Alternate install (per user to `~/`)
```
$ python3 setup.py install --home
```

Alternate install (custom to `/path/to`)
```
$ python3 setup.py install --prefix=/path/to
```

Each execution of `setup.py` script in the above examples also installs files in the `scripts` to the corresponding `bin` subdirectory.

### Generate Python source distribution

See
[The Python Tutorial: Distributing Python Modules](http://docs.python.org/3/istutils/)
to learn `distutils` from developer's perspective.

The `setup.py` script of `distutils` can generate Python source distribution from the source tree containing Python modules and script files.

Generate Python source distribution
```
$ python3 setup.py sdist
```

This creates a `dist/foo-1.0.tar.gz` tar ball file for the Python source distribution.

### Example #1 of Python source distribution

Let's populate the `fridge` directory with a few files to make Python source distribution.

* `fridge.py` : Python module `fridge` to be packaged (see [ Python inheritance](#python_inheritance)).
* `README` : Package description
* `setup.py` : Package configuration for the Python source distribution.
* `scripts/jane`, ... : Python script using Python module `fridge`.

Let's make a source tree for Python module `fridge`.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-ls1.log" >}}


Please note "`py_modules=['fridge'],`" in `setup.py` which tells to
use the `fridge.py` file as the `fridge` module.

Let's execute `setup.py` and generate Python source distribution

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-setup.log" >}}


Let's see the updated source tree for fridge

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-ls2.log" >}}


You see few files generated.

* `MANIFEST` : auto generated by distutils.
* `dist` : directory for generated Python source distribution packages.
* `dist/fridge-1.0.tar.gz` :  Python source distribution package.
* `PKG-INFO` in `dist/fridge-1.0.tar.gz` : Metadata for Python source distribution package generated from the `setup.py` file.

Let's untar Python source distribution package and install as user.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-copy.log" >}}


Unfortunately, `distutils` as of now does not offer uninstall.  We need to remove files manually to uninstall them.

Let's uninstall Python source distribution manually.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-rm.log" >}}


### Example #2 of Python source distribution

Let's try an alternative Python source distribution with [Python module package](#python-module-package).

Basically, move `fridge/fridge.py` in Example #1 to `fridge/src/fridge/__init__.py`.

Let's execute this.


{{< snippet "examples/python/package3/fridge-py.log" >}}


Let's populate the `fridge` directory with mostly the same files except:

* `src/fridge/__init__.py` : Python module `fridge` to be packaged insted of `fridge.py` (see [Python module package](#python-module-package)).
* `setup.py` : Package configuration for the Python source distribution (Contents of the file updated).

Let's make a source tree for Python module `fridge`.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package3/fridge-ls1.log" >}}


Please note "`package_dir={'fridge': 'src/fridge'},`" in `setup.py` which tells
to use files in the `src/fridge` directory as the `fridge` module package.

Let's execute `setup.py` and generate Python source distribution

{{< snippet "examples/python/package3/fridge-setup.log" >}}


Let's see the updated source tree for fridge

{{< snippet "examples/python/package3/fridge-ls2.log" >}}


You see few files generated.

* `MANIFEST` : auto generated by distutils.
* `dist` : directory for generated Python source distribution packages.
* `dist/fridge-1.0.tar.gz` :  Python source distribution package.
* `PKG-INFO` in `dist/fridge-1.0.tar.gz` : Metadata for Python source distribution package generated from the `setup.py` file.

Let's untar Python source distribution package and install as user.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-copy.log" >}}


Unfortunately, `distutils` as of now does not offer uninstall.  We need to remove files manually to uninstall them.

Let's uninstall Python source distribution manually.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-rm.log" >}}


### Debian package from Python2 source distribution (dh_make)

The `dh_make` is handy for making a Debian package.  I will be very sloppy for now.  (More work is needed to make package suitable for Debian.)

Let's make Debian source package.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package1/fridge-debsrc.log" >}}


Here, I add the package dependency etc. to `debian/control`.

Let's make Debian binary package.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package1/fridge-debpkg.log" >}}


Now we have Debian package `fridge_1.0-1_all.deb` which can be installed and removed easily.

### Debian package from Python3 source distribution (dh_make)

Let's do the same for Python3.

Let's make Debian source package.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-debsrc.log" >}}


Here, I am working around lack of Python3 support
([#538978](http://bugs.debian.org/538978) and
[#597105](http://bugs.debian.org/597105) bugs) by `debhelper` using the
customized build script `debian/rules` following
http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/python-packaging.html[Ubuntu
documentation on "Packaging Python modules and applications"]

Let's make Debian binary package.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-debpkg.log" >}}


Now we have Debian package `fridge_1.0-1_all.deb` which can be installed and removed easily.

### Debian package from Python2 source distribution (debmake)

The `debmake` is even more handier for making a Debian package.  I will be very sloppy for now as well.  (More work is needed to make package suitable for Debian.)

Let's make Debian source package.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package1/fridge-debmake.log" >}}


Now we have Debian package `fridge_1.0-1_all.deb` which can be installed and removed easily.

### Debian package from Python3 source distribution (debmake)

Let's do the same for Python3 (The `debmake` does hard work for you).

Let's make Debian source package.

{{< snippet "examples/python/package2/fridge-debmake.log" >}}


Now we have Debian package `fridge_1.0-1_all.deb` which can be installed and removed easily.

### Python + C

For non-trivial tasks, it is good idea to write major parts of the program in
some high level programing language such as Python using modules, with some
mission-critical small parts of the program as Python modules written in C (or
in any compiled languages) for speed.

There are several approaches to mix [Python](http://docs.python.org/3/) and C/C++
code.

* [ctypes](http://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html):
    * ctypes can use existing C libraries as a Python extension module without
   compilation.
    * You need to understand how C works to use this.
    * This is not as fast as other methods but is easier to use.
*  [Python support of SWIG](http://swig.org/Doc2.0/Python.html):
    * [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) is a specialized compiler that transforms
   ANSI C/C++ declarations into scripting language extension wrappers.
      * The interface file "*.i" wraps ANSI C/C++ declarations.
      * Python is one of many scripting languages supported by SWIG.
    * You need to understand how C/C++ works to use this.
    * This is good if you have many libraries to be wrapped.
* [PyGObject](https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject)
    * This is basically for GNOME3 (see [PyGObject](/en/2013/08/16/fun2prog-gnome/#pygobject)).
    * PyGObject binds
   [GObject](http://developer.gnome.org/gobject/unstable/pt02.html)
   as Python extension module using
   [GObject Introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection) with a
   "*.gir" file.
    * [GObject Introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection) provides
   tighter binding than [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/).
* [Cython](http://www.cython.org/):
    * Cython is a superset of the [Python](http://docs.python.org/3/) language.
      * Cython code "*.pyx" generates an optimized C code.
      * Cython supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and
    class attributes.
    * Cython makes writing C extensions for the Python language as easy as Python
   itself.
      * [Tutorials](http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial)
* [Python/C API](http://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html):
    * A custom C/C++ code with the header `#include "Python.h"`
   can access the native Python/C API.
    * You need to understand how C/C++ works to use this.
    * You need to understand how the Python Interpreter works to use this.
    * This enables both extending and embedding of the
   [Python](http://www.python.org/) Interpreter.
