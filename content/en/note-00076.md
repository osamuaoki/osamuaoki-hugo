## Neovim setup situation.

Since I was getting tired of constantly evolving Lazyvim, I took time to
investigate alternative preconfigured Nvim setups.

Upstream [https://neovim.io/](https://neovim.io/) has links to:

- [Trending Neovim Plugins](https://dotfyle.com/neovim/plugins/trending)
- [This Week in Neovim](https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim)

I realize that once popular
[LunarVim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim)
is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/discussions/4518#discussioncomment-8963843)
([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1caaldi/lunarvim_has_been_abandoned_by_maintainers/)).

The overview of neovim plugins for "preconfigured-configuration" is available
at:

- [neovimcraft site](https://neovimcraft.com/?search=tag%3Apreconfigured-configuration)
- [awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#preconfigured-configuration)

These lead me to the conclusion that all actively maintained
"preconfigured-configuration" uses
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the plugin manager.

Following 4 plugin managers seemed interesting. Here are images after typing
`<space>` in NORMAL mode.

- [LazyVim's official starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) -- cluttered
  - ![screen_lz](/img/Screen_lz.png)
- [AstroNvim's template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) -- nice, compact, usable
  - ![screen_as](/img/Screen_as.png)
- [NvChad's official starter](https://github.com/NvChad/starter) -- compact but vague
  - ![screen_nv](/img/Screen_nv.png)
- [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) -- good baseline for experiments
  - ![screen_ks](/img/Screen_ks.png)

After some tries, I decided to migrate back to AstroNvim (now V4).

## Migration tries to AstroNvim

See [AstroNvim with osamu's customization](https://github.com/osamuaoki/template) which has most of key features I had in my LazyVim setup.

I updated values for `vim.opt` to conform to OPT-IN philosophy for features.

Newly added notable definitions are:

- `opt.timeoutlen = 300` (AstroNvim default seems to be 500. Matches LazyVim.)
- `g.editorconfig = false` (nil -> explicit false)
- Somehow my intial try of `:set hls` didn't work as expected.

Ater some tries, I got annoyed by the system default overriding and setting
syntax (especially keymap).

Also, I realized my rocky experience of LazyVim seemed to have come from
LazyExtra package setting lost by git command.  It was not checked in and
was very prone to be erased.

Since AstroNvim had 2 nice features over LazyVim:

- Compact and visually easy which-key menu.
- Many native option features had `<leader>u` bindings to toggle and set.
- `nvim` v0.9 supported

## Coming back to LazyVim

Since I am using `nvim` v0.10 series, I decided to enhance LazyVim by adding
missing features (2024-06-21).

- [LazyVim customized](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) after typing `<leader>`
  - ![screenlz0](/img/Screenlz0.png)
- [LazyVim customized](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) after typing `<leader>u`
  - ![screenlz1](/img/Screenlz1.png)
- [LazyVim customized](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) after typing `<leader>x`
  - ![screenlz2](/img/Screenlz2.png)

(This customization is on-going activity.)

I think I have good enough for my normal uses.

I keep diagnose and spellcheck are ON but most of auto-input features are off.

I ended up not to install `bqf-nvim` nor `qf.nvim` since LazyVim had enough
capability without them for managing Quickfix List.

This is because LazyVim uses `telescope` or `fzf-lua`.  It can provide quickfix list
down-selection capability as installed.  With customization as described below, it can manage quickfix history too.

### Quickfix history

Please note down-selected list from both Quickfix list and Location list are
sent to the top of the quickfix list history.

For my ease of operation, I made duplicate keybings for `<leader>sq` etc. in `<leader>xq` etc..

Quickfix and Location List shown in Telescope can be operated using:

- `<Tab>`: Mark item
- `<S-Tab>`: Un-mark item
- `<C-q>`: Send all items **not marked** to quickfixlist (qflist)
- `<M-q>`: Send all items **marked** to quickfixlist (qflist)

Quickfix list history can be
managed via Telescope by adding the following keymap:

```lua
map("n", "<leader>xh", "<cmd>Telescope quickfixhistory<cr>", { desc = "Quickfix History" })
```

With this setup, I don't need any more plugins to use quickfix features.

NOTE: I updated to use LazyExtras `editor.fzf`.  So no more `Telescope ...` but
`FzfLua ...` and also desc = "Quickfix Stack (FzfLua)"

(I think XML tag insert and tripple-backtick insert features are ON by some FT plugin.)

NOTE: Many features get decent defaults in LazyVim than stock `nvim`.

* `:set virtualedit="block"`
* [Saner behavior of n and N](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore#saner-behavior-of-n-and-n)

## which-key v3 updates

I updated [my LazyVim customization](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) further on 2024-08-11.  Now notices are dismissed when `<esc>` is pressed.

Also, `<leader>u`-group is more interesting:

![leader-u-group](/img/leader-u.png)

## LazyVim v14 updates (2025-08-28)

I updated my system setup to use the
[updated LazyVim customized starter](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter).

My system runs `nvim` at its version: `NVIM v0.11.4-dev-47+ge6ea97a691` with `LuaJIT 2.1.1741730670` and `LazyVim` module at `v14`-series
