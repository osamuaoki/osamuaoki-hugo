## Neovim setup situation.

Since I was getting tired of constantly evolving Lazyvim, I took time to
investigate alternative preconfigured Nvim setups.

Upstream [https://neovim.io/](https://neovim.io/) has links to:

- [Trending Neovim Plugins](https://dotfyle.com/neovim/plugins/trending)
- [This Week in Neovim](https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim)

I realize that once popular
[LunarVim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim)
is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/discussions/4518#discussioncomment-8963843)
([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1caaldi/lunarvim_has_been_abandoned_by_maintainers/)).

The overview of neovim plugins for "preconfigured-configuration" is available
at:

- [neovimcraft site](https://neovimcraft.com/?search=tag%3Apreconfigured-configuration)
- [awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#preconfigured-configuration)

These lead me to the conclusion that all actively maintained
"preconfigured-configuration" uses
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the plugin manager.

Following 4 plugin managers seemed interesting.

- [LazyVim's official starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) -- getting cluttered
  - ![screen_lz](/img/Screen_lz.png)
- [AstroNvim's template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) -- nicest !
  - ![screen_as](/img/Screen_as.png)
- [NvChad's official starter](https://github.com/NvChad/starter)
  - ![screen_nv](/img/Screen_nv.png)
- [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) -- baseline only
  - ![screen_ks](/img/Screen_ks.png)

After some tries, I decided to migrate back to AstroNvim (now V4).

See [AstroNvim with osamu's customization](https://github.com/osamuaoki/template) which has most of what I had in my LazyVim setup.

> NOTE:
> [Lazyman Neovim Configuration Manager](https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman)
> was interesting meta-manager for these "preconfigured-configuration" but it was
> a overkill and too much complication.
