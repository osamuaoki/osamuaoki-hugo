## Neovim setup situation.

Since I was getting tired of constantly evolving Lazyvim, I took time to
investigate alternative preconfigured Nvim setups.

Upstream [https://neovim.io/](https://neovim.io/) has links to:

- [Trending Neovim Plugins](https://dotfyle.com/neovim/plugins/trending)
- [This Week in Neovim](https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim)

I realize that once popular
[LunarVim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim)
is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/discussions/4518#discussioncomment-8963843)
([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1caaldi/lunarvim_has_been_abandoned_by_maintainers/)).

The overview of neovim plugins for "preconfigured-configuration" is available
at:

- [neovimcraft site](https://neovimcraft.com/?search=tag%3Apreconfigured-configuration)
- [awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#preconfigured-configuration)

These lead me to the conclusion that all actively maintained
"preconfigured-configuration" uses
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the plugin manager.

Following 4 plugin managers seemed interesting. Here are images after typing
`<space>` in NORMAL mode.

- [LazyVim's official starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) -- cluttered
  - ![screen_lz](/img/Screen_lz.png)
- [AstroNvim's template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) -- nice, compact, usable
  - ![screen_as](/img/Screen_as.png)
- [NvChad's official starter](https://github.com/NvChad/starter) -- compact but vague
  - ![screen_nv](/img/Screen_nv.png)
- [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) -- good baseline for experiments
  - ![screen_ks](/img/Screen_ks.png)

After some tries, I decided to migrate back to AstroNvim (now V4).

## Migration tries to AstroNvim

See [AstroNvim with osamu's customization](https://github.com/osamuaoki/template) which has most of key features I had in my LazyVim setup.

I updated values for `vim.opt` to conform to OPT-IN philosophy for features.

Newly added notable definitions are:

- `opt.timeoutlen = 300` (AstroNvim default seems to be 500. Matches LazyVim.)
- `g.editorconfig = false` (nil -> explicit false)
- Somehow my intial try of `:set hls` didn't work as expected.

After some tries, I got annoyed by the system default overriding and setting
syntax (especially keymap).

Also, I realized my rocky experience of LazyVim seemed to have come from
LazyExtra package setting lost by git command.  It was not checked in and
was very prone to be erased.

Since AstroNvim had 2 nice features over LazyVim:

- Compact and visually easy which-key menu.
- Many native option features had `<leader>u` bindings to toggle and set.
- `nvim` v0.9 supported

## Coming back to LazyVim

Since I am using `nvim` v0.10 series, I decided to enhance LazyVim by adding
missing features (2024-06-21).

- [LazyVim customized](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) after typing `<leader>`
  - ![screenlz0](/img/Screenlz0.png)
- [LazyVim customized](https://github.com/osamuaoki/starter) after typing `<leader>u`
  - ![screenlz1](/img/Screenlz1.png)

I think I have good enough for my normal uses.

I keep diagnose and spellcheck are ON but most of auto-input features are off.

(I think XML tag insert is ON by some FT plugin.)
