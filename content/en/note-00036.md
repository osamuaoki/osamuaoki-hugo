Let me keep up note on configuring and administrating my Sony Vaio SVT1313
(Intel i5) under Debian GNU/Linux.  This is a second hand used PC which costed
me about $100 as total after fixing its keyboard.

This is hardware specific tips.

## Hardware of Sony VAIO

Pressing **ASSIST** button instead of **POWER** button starts PC with boot
device and BIOS setting selection menu.

I got this machine as second hand. This PC came with [a buggy
UEFI](https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI#Force_grub-efi_installation_manually) which
refuses to accommodate dual boot scenario with reasonable usability.

* I ended up selecting "legacy" mode to use MBR.  No more secure boot.
* I replaced the internal keyboard.  (Missing key event problems on "e", "u"
  and "Delete" are fixed.)
* The card side contacts of SO-DDR DRAM needed to be rubbed by eraser to get it
  work right.

## Touchpad of Sony VAIO

Touch pad only functions as left-click button.  I verified it by opening its
touch pad to see one button switch under it.  So realizing left/right click needs some driver
support.  So far under Wayland, I didn't see any easy solution. Interesting references are:

 * https://xorg-team.pages.debian.net/xorg/howto/configure-input.html
 * https://www.linux.org/threads/right-click-with-macbook.9667/
 * https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/mouse-mousekeys.html.en
 * https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/a11y-right-click.html.en

For Mac or some Sony Vaio with single tap pad button, this allows secondary
click under the current GNOME.

* Settings
* -> Accessibility
* -> Pointing & Clicking: Click Assist On
* -> Simulated Secondary Click ON
