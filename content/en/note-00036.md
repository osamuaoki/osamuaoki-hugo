Let me keep up note on configuring and administrating my Sony Vaio SVT1313
(Intel i5) under Debian GNU/Linux.  This is a second hand used PC which costed
me about $100 as total after fixing its keyboard.

This is hardware specific tips.

## How to access BIOS menu of Sony VAIO SVT1313

Pressing **ASSIST** button instead of **POWER** button starts PC with boot
device and BIOS setting selection menu.

## Why boot with MBR and not with UEFI

I got this machine as second hand. This PC came with [a buggy
UEFI](https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI#Force_grub-efi_installation_manually) which
refuses to accommodate dual boot scenario with reasonable usability.

* I ended up selecting "legacy" mode to use MBR in BIOS.  No more secure boot.
* I replaced the internal keyboard.  (Missing key event problems on "e", "u"
  and "Delete" are fixed.)
* The card side contacts of SO-DDR DRAM needed to be rubbed by eraser to get it
  work right.

## Btrfs as root filesystem on MBR system

* For MBR system, grub-pc is used.  This requires `/boot` to be on ext4 filesystem.
* If `/` is on btrfs filesystem via debian-installer, it uses `subvol=@rootfs`
  as installed (Debian 12 bookworm).

## Touchpad of Sony VAIO

Touch pad only functions as left-click button.  I verified it by opening its
touch pad to see one button switch under it.  So realizing left/right click needs some driver
support.  So far under Wayland, I didn't see any easy solution. Interesting references are:

 * https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=597082
 * https://xorg-team.pages.debian.net/xorg/howto/configure-input.html
 * https://www.linux.org/threads/right-click-with-macbook.9667/
 * https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/mouse-mousekeys.html.en
 * https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/a11y-right-click.html.en

I initially used following (now deprecated) setup.

* ~~Settings~~
* -> ~~Accessibility~~
* -> ~~Pointing & Clicking: Click Assist On~~
* -> ~~Simulated Secondary Click ON~~

This method yields not-so-good user experiences when I wanted to open a linked
page to another browser tab page with "right-click & select":

* Press TP
* --> No left- nor right- pressed event
* Hold TP
* --> Timer displayed to wait
* Release TP after timer
* --> Left-released event (annoying)
* --> Right-click (==pressed then released)

I then found interesting setting in GNOME Tweak.


* Tweaks
* -> "Keyboard and Mouse" tab
* -> "Mouse Click Emulation" section
  * -> Check on "Area"

For Mac or some Sony Vaio with single tap pad button, this allows secondary
click as expected.
