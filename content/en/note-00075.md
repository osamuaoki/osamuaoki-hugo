## An example C program with Makefile

In order to practice with a simple C program, I created [`test.c` and `Makefile`
at github](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamuaoki-hugo-proj/tree/master/021_gcc_debug).

Let me recap basic GCC options used in this example together with some popular
situation.

* CPP
  * `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`: add checks for buffer overflows via CPP
  (pre-processor)
    * GCC warns for unused return value for function such as `scanf(...)` with
      this.
* GCC optimization
  * `-O0`: default optimization if not specified -> May yield uninitialized variable memory
  * `-Og`: optimization for debug
  * `-O2`: optimization for normal use
* GCC warning
  * `-Wall`: Enable every warning
  * `-Werror`: Error for warning
  * `-g`: Produce debug symbol in the operating system's native format (GDB compatible)
  * `-ggdb`: Produce debug symbol by GDB (with extra data)
* Other GCC notable options
 * `-E`: Get the preprocessor output only
 * `-S`: Get the assembly code
 * `-V`: Get the verbose output of compilation
 * `-fPIC`: Get a position-independent code
 * `-Wl,option`: Linker option
   * `-Wl,-z,relo`: pass `-z relo` to LD.
* LD (linker) option
  * `-l`: Link with a shared library
    * `-lm`: link with math library
  * `-L`: Specify the location of the external library
  * `-z relro`: memory segment made read-only after relocation

Uninitialized variable was zeroed by code generated by `-Og` and `-O2` but not
by `-O0`. So I should use `-O2` or `-Og` to make debug easy.

## Jump to errors in the source code: C program example with quickfix

Above example compiles without issue.  So let me intensionally break it by
removing `;` in some lines by editing with:

```console
$ vi test.c
```

While in Nvim, let me type `:make` in NORMAL mode.  This runs the content of
`Makefile` with `make`.  It sure causes errors and the cursor moves to the
first error position. I can jump around errors with `[q` and `]q`.  Cool.

I can also open quickfix list window with `:copen`.

Pressing ENTER on quickfix list window line jumps cursor to its corresponding
position.

## Inspect running program (direct GDB)

Use of GDB was touched in [Fun to Program â€“ Debug: level 3]({{<ref fun2-00012.md>}}).

```console
$ make
$ gdb -q ./test
Reading symbols from ./test...
(gdb) list 1,15
1	#include <stdlib.h>
2	#include <stdio.h>
3	int main() {
4	  int i, final, factorial = 1;
5	  printf("Enter the number: ");
6	  if (scanf("%d", &final)) {
7	    for (i = 1; i <= final; i++)
8	      factorial = factorial * i;
9	    printf("The factorial of %d is %d\n", final, factorial);
10	    exit(0);
11	  } else {
12	    exit(1);
13	  }
14	}
(gdb) b 8
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1199: file test.c, line 8.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/osamu/github/osamuaoki.github.io/osamuaoki-hugo-proj/021_gcc_debug/test
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
Enter the number: 17

Breakpoint 1, main () at test.c:8
8	      factorial = factorial * i;
(gdb) info locals
i = 1
final = 17
factorial = 1
(gdb) c 16
Will ignore next 15 crossings of breakpoint 1.  Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, main () at test.c:8
8	      factorial = factorial * i;
(gdb) info locals
i = 17
final = 17
factorial = 2004189184
(gdb) n
7	    for (i = 1; i <= final; i++)
(gdb) n
9	    printf("The factorial of %d is %d\n", final, factorial);
(gdb) info locals
i = 18
final = 17
factorial = -288522240
(gdb) n
The factorial of 17 is -288522240
10	    exit(0);
(gdb) c
Continuing.
[Inferior 1 (process 72091) exited normally]
```

Since 17 * 2,004,189,184 =  36,507,221,999, and `int` is 32 bit signed integer,  overflow occurred (max = 0x7FFF_FFFF= 2,147,483,647).


## Inspect running program (remote GDB)

Let's think about simple single host with 2 terminal console case.

On console GDBSERVER (remote), let's start `gdbserver` to test `./test`:
```console
$ gdbserver localhost:1234 ./test
Process ./test created; pid = 32761
Listening on port 1234
```

On console GDB (local), start `gdb`:

```console
$ gdb -q
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
(gdb) b 7
Breakpoint 1 at 0x55555555519c: file test.c, line 7.
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Reading /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 from remote target...
```

On console GDBSERVER, we see the following and enter `5` on prompt.

```console
Remote debugging from host ::1, port 60566
Enter the number: 5
```

On console GDB, start `gdb`:

```console
Breakpoint 1, main () at test.c:7
```

With above, `./test` is tested with full access to stdin and stdout.


## Inspect running program (via DAP)

Since Debian/Bookworm 12 currently has GDB 13, we need to follow
"[C C Rust (gdb via vscode cpptools)](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/C-C---Rust-(gdb-via--vscode-cpptools))"
using
"[github: microsoft/vscode-cpptools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools)".
LazyVim can activate `dap.core` LazyExtra and activate `cpptools ` and
`codelldb` in DAP by running `:Mason` (or `<leader>cm`).

Next GDB 14 can support [DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol)](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) natively.

Problem is Nvim with DAP UI doesn't seem to allow running program using STDIN.

## Jump to the specific position in a file: generic Vim

Let me revisit trick to jump to the specific position manually.

To go to line 99 of `file.txt`, try:
```console
$ vim +99 file.txt
```

To go to line 99 column 40 of `file.txt`, try any one of the following:
```console
$ vim +99 file.txt +'norm 40|'
$ vim file.txt +'norm 99G40|'
$ vim +'call cursor(99, 40)' file.txt
```
NOTE: `|` (bar) in NORMAL mode is "goto column", and in EX-mode is "command
separator".
NOTE: Indexing for line and column in Vim starts at 1. `0G` is for the last
line.  (List index in Vim Script starts at 0.)
