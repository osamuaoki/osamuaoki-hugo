The `git submodule update --init` is nice.  I checked how all these repos are managed.

If I want to move submodule, I don't need delete and clone again.  I can simply move it with "`git mv <oldpath> <newpath>`" while we keep using the same local copy of repo.

Let's see how this is done.

## `<modulename>/.gitmodules`

This file is checked in to the parent Git repository and contains:

```
[submodule "pack/github/opt/ale"]
        path = pack/ale
        url = https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale.git
```

* `submodule`-line is where local bare cloned repo exists.  For this case,
   `<modulename>/.git/modules/pack/github/opt/ale` -- **PATH_BARE**
* `path`-line is where the submodule are checked out. -- **PATH_CHECKOUT**
* `url`-line is where remote repo is. -- **URL**


The checked out repo can be moved by `git mv`.

## `<modulename>/pack/ale/.git`

This is created by `git submodule` in the submodule directory and has `gitdir: ../../.git/modules/pack/github/opt/ale` in it pointing to where local bare cloned repo exists. -- **PATH_BARE**

## `<modulename>/.git/submodule/pack/github/opt/ale/config`

This is deep in the subdirectory of the parent Git repository's `.git` directory where the bare clone of submodule repository exists.

```
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        worktree = ../../../../../../pack/ale
[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
```

* `worktree`-line s where the submodule are checked out.  -- **PATH_CHECKOUT**
* `url`-line is where remote repo is. -- **URL**


## `<modulename>/.git/config`

This is in the parent Git repository's `.git` and its main configuration.  For submodule, this has:

```
[submodule "pack/github/opt/ale"]
        active = true
        url = https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale.git
```

* `submodule`-line is where local bare cloned repo exists.  For this case,
   `<modulename>/.git/modules/pack/github/opt/ale`.  -- **PATH_BARE**
* `url`-line is where remote repo is.  -- **URL**
