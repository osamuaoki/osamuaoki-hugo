## GNOME

The choice of the best GUI program practice is not simple since there are many
choices for GUI platforms, many outdated documentations, new features without
updated tutorials, and future uncertainties.

Despite people had very negative reaction to the GNOME3 due to its new default
user experience, I chose it as my GUI example platform for its fundamental
internal technical merits.  We can always customize the user experience part.

Here is my best effort to capture the recent GUI framework history for GNOME
and best sources for references.  (The latest stable is GNOME3.4 as of 2012 Summer.)

### GNOME history

[GTK+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+) is the GUI toolkit for
[GNOME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) and is build on the top of C with
[GLib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLib) and
[GObject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject).  It requires many chores with
boiler plate macro definitions when used directly from a C program.  Its
modularity as a GUI toolkit has evolved roughly as follows.

* GTK+1.0 (1998): just separated from [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/about/ancient_history.html).
* GTK+1.2 (1999): reasonable shape for general applications.
* GTK+2.0 (2002): for GNOME2 based on GLib, GObject, GIO, ATK, GDK, GdkPixbuff
* GTK+3.0 (2011): for GNOME3 based on GLib, GObject, GIO, ATK, GDK, GdkPixbuff, [Pango](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pango)
    * GTK+3.0 works with [Cairo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_(graphics)), [Clutter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter_(toolkit)), and [GObject-introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/), ...

[GNOME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) has evolved significantly with its
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication[inter-process
communication (IPC)] structure.  Its history is roughly as follows.

* GNOME1 (1999): [CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA) (= [Bonobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(component_model)) + libIDL + ORBit) as IPC established.
* GNOME2 (2002): Antialiased fonts, UNICODE support (internationalization), HIG compliance (accessibility), ...
    * GNOME2 cycle: IPC migrated from CORBA to [D-Bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus).
* GNOME3 (2011): D-Bus as IPC established. ([CORBA deprecated](http://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/2.32/bonobo-corba.html.en))
    * GNOME3 cycle: [GObject-Introspection](https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/) is introduced.
      * [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) is becoming a popular choice to write applications for the native binary target instead of traditional and complicated C code with many boiler plate macro definitions.
      * [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) with [PyGObject](https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject) is a popular choice to write applications under the high level interpreter language with [JIT compilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation).
      * [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is becoming the choice for the embedded language of applications with the [Gjs](https://live.gnome.org/Gjs) binding.

GNOME3 applications are just plain GTK+3 applications.  There is no code bloat
by [CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA) any more.

https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Users[The language binding system
based on GObject-Introspection] can provide:

* tighter binding including the memory management than the generic language binding systems such as [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) can, and
* more consistent binding across different languages.

GObject-Introspection xml data of each library can be found under the `/usr/share/gir-1.0` directory.
