## Neovim migration

After finding out **Neovim** (nvim) starts up 30%-40% faster than **Vim 8**
probably due to asynchronous processing and more effective use of multi-core
modern CPU, I decided to migrate to nvim.  Then lua thing got my attention.
Since nvim source package for version 0.5 was available in Debian experimental,
I made a local package from it.  So I am in good shape to try the latest lua
scripts.

After translating my old vimrc to lua as https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-nvim
, I realized this isn't going anywhere.  It was easy to convert
`.config/nvim/init.vim` but it was hard to decide how to migrate all my vimL
based packages to new new lua based ones.

I found 2 interesting projects which offer examples for how this is done.

* Lunar Vim
  * SRC: https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim
  * HOME: https://www.lunarvim.org/#opinionated
* NvChad
  * SRC: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad
  * WIKI: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/wiki (old?
  * HOME: https://nvchad.netlify.app/

For ease of customization, I chose NvChad.  Result was great start-up time
reduction.

* vim  230 ms (dot-vim in vimL)
* nvim 161 ms (dot-nvim in lua starting vimL packages)
* nvim  65 ms (NvChad in all lua)

Here is my memo on how to use NvChad and customize it.

## Installation (non-invasive)

This will not change your current vi or vim behavior.

You start nvim configured with NvChad by the `nv` command.

(For below, I assume https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/pull/460 and associated
https://github.com/NvChad/extensions/pull/1
are accepted.  Until then use https://github.com/osamuaoki/NvChad instead and
rebase it to the upstream HEAD and hand patch extension locally.)

```
$ git clone git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim-NvChad
$ cd ~/.config/nvim-NvChad
$ ./nv -c "autocmd User PackerComplete quitall" -c "PackerSync
```

* Copy `nv` file to a directory in early `$PATH` such as `$HOME/.local/bin`
or `$HOME/bin`. `nv` will start NvChad configured nvim.

```
$ cp nv ~/.local/bin/
```

* (Optional) Rename or copy the nv to names such as `vi` or `vim` to
start this as default for those names. (Remove them to get your old
ways)


NOTE: The above is based on docker install guide.
https://nvchad.netlify.app/getting-started/setup suggests to use `<SPACE>uu` in
normal mode which invokes `:NvChadUpdate <CR>`.  It in turn invokes
nvchad/update_nvchad in extension.  I need to come back what are the
differences.

Extra definition of key bindings are possible but those do not show up in list
shown by `<leader>uk`.  Also, any syntax errors in the key binding definition
cause very cryptic error messages.

Any trouble seems to break **:PackerCompile** result.  Run it.

I also set as:
```
$ git config pull.rebase true
```

(I proposed update of NvChad along this so we can make changes not just in
chadrc)

My idea is to use 2 local repos.

* Make 2 repos.
  * **OFF** configuration directory repo  (scratch pad repo)
  * **ON** configuration directory.       (configuration repo)
* pull --rebase upstream changes to **main** of **OFF**-repo.
* Rebase **local** branch on to the tip of **main** safely in **OFF**-repo.
* Force push **local** to my remote repo as back up. (optional)
* After creating cleanly rebased **local** in **OFF*-repo, pull **local**. branch from **OFF*-repo to **ON**-repo.


## Dummy's guide to NvChad

NvChad is so clean-looking without menu.  I need clue how to use its
functionalities beyond what I do normally with plain vim/nvim.

Compared to my previous setup of total of 409 lines, it seems to involve over
1721 lines in its main and extension has 544 lines.  So I need a place to start
:-) 


* User configuration file: `~/.config/nvim{-NvChad,}/lua/chadrc.lua
  * Change to `timeoutlen = 1500` -- (until I get used to it.)
  * Change to `dashboard = true` -- (until I get used to it.)
* Key bindings: [Let's see how different from my previous settings.](https://nvchad.netlify.app/config#mappings)
  * INSERT mode:

  | Key default  | My way       |function               |
  |--------------|--------------|-----------------------|
  |`jk`	         |              |to NORMAL mode (as `<ESC>`)	|
  |`<C-h>`	     |              |`<Left>`	|
  |`<C-j>`	     |              |`<Down>`	|
  |`<C-k>`	     |              |`<Up>`	|
  |`<C-l>`	     |              |`<Right>`	|
  |`<C-a>`	     |              |`<Home>`	|
  |`<C-e>`	     |              |`<End>`	|


Although I wanted to keep these cursor key bindings to be along normal shell
like key bindings, Nvim was tricky enough for me to set cedit from
`<C-F>` to `<C-O>`.  So I gave up shell-like key bindings and now use the
NvChad default.  

  * NORMAL MODE basic featurs (file, buffer and mode related settings):

  | Key default  | My way     |function               |
  |--------------|------------|-----------------------|
  |`<C-n>` 	     |`<leader>m` |toggle file manager window (nvim-tree) |
  |`<TAB>`	     |            |cycle active buffer (forward) |
  |`<S-TAB>`     |            |cycle active buffer (backward) |
  |`T`           |`<leader>o` |open a new buffer	  |
  |`<C-s>`       |            |save buffers	  |
  |`<leader>x`   |            |close current buffer	(hides a terminal) |
  |`<leader>bm`  |            |bookmark (dashboard) |
  |`<leader>fn`  |            |create new buffer (dashboard) |
  |`<leader>db`  |            |open dashboard (dashboard) |
  |`<leader>l`   |            |load a saved session (dashboard) |
  |`<leader>s`   |            |save a session (dashboard) |
  |`<C-a>`       |`<leader>a` |copy all |
  |`<leader>n`   |            |toggle line number |
  |`<leader>/`   |            |toggle commenting a line |
  |`<leader>dk`  |            |View default key mappings (chadsheet) |
  |`<leader>uk`  |            |View uset key mappings (chadsheet) |
  |`<leader>uu`  |            |update NvChad |
  |`<leader>th`  |            |theme selector with demo |
  |`<leader>tt`  |            |theme toggler |
  |`<leader>h`   |            |new terminal with horizontal split |
  |`<leader>v`   |            |new terminal with vertical split  |
  |`<leader>w`   |            |new terminal over current window  |


  * NORMAL MODE fancy featurs (Telescope etc.):

  | Key default  |          ? |        function               |
  |--------------|------------|-----------------------|
  |`<leader>ff`  |            |find a file (Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>fb`  |            |select a buffer (Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>cm`  |            |select a commit from commit history (Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>gt`  | ?          |git status	(Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>fh`  |            |select a tag from help tags (Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>fw`  |            |live grep (Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>fo`  |            |old files (Telescope picker) |
  |`<leader>W`   |`<leader>p` |select terminal (Telescope picker)  |
  |`<leader>zz`  | ?          |center (True zen) |
  |`<leader>zf`  | ?          |focus (True zen) |
  |`<leader>zm`  | ?          |minimalistic (True zen) |
  |`<leader>gh`  | ?          |diff2 (fugitives) |
  |`<leader>gl`  | ?          |diff3 (fugitives) |
  |`<leader>gs`  | ?          |git (fugitives) |
  |`<leader>gb`  | ?          |git blame (fugitives) |


I prefer SPACE over CTRL-key, lower case over upper case.

(NvChad to overrid non-esoteric vi NORMAL MODE `T` key was a very bad idea.  )

I am keeping mostly default key bindings for now.
