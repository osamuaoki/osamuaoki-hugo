## CMake revisited

Since Neovim uses CMake as its build system, I made quick review of its usage
after reading following interesting references.

* [CMake Reference: CPack DEB Generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/cpack_gen/deb.html)
* [Making a deb package with CMake/CPack and hosting it in a private APT repository](https://decovar.dev/blog/2021/09/23/cmake-cpack-package-deb-apt/)
* [Effective Modern CMake](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1)
* [Everything You Never Wanted to Know About CMake](https://izzys.casa/2019/02/everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-cmake/)

### CMake basics

The good old way to configure a source package with CMake is as follows:

```sh
$ cd path/to/source
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake [<options>] ..
```

Then, build and install the configured source package with the generated build
system, e.g., "Unix Makefile" is as follows (executed in `build/` directory):

```sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Here, this build and install process can also be done with the build system agnostic way as:

```sh
$ cmake --build . --verbose
$ sudo cmake --install . --verbose
```

### CMake and DEB-package

This above basic method installs binary executables directory to the system.
The removal of installed files is a bit tricky.  It will be nice if we can
create a DEB-package and install it with `dpkg -i <packagename>.deb`.  Then its
clean removal is intuitive process.

```sh
$ cmake --build . --verbose
$ cpack -G DEB --verbose
$ sudo dpkg -i <packagename>-linux64.deb
```

Please note this is not how official Debian packages are build.  This CMake
functionality merely creates a DEB-package compliant to its bunary package
format without adding `debian/*` files.

If `cpack` is invoked without `-G DEB`, this also builds TGZ-package.

## Prebuild Neovim DEB-package

### Debian Neovim DEB-package

[Debian ships Neovim](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/neovim) based on
[upstream Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
v0.7.2 version (released on 2022-06-27) for the upcoming bookworm release.

Please note this uses external libraries via shared library mechanism.

```sh
$ ldd /usr/bin/nvim
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffec159e000)
        liblua5.1-luv.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1-luv.so.0 (0x00007f4788c16000)
        libuv.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libuv.so.1 (0x00007f4788be6000)
        libmsgpackc.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmsgpackc.so.2 (0x00007f4788bdd000)
        libvterm.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libvterm.so.0 (0x00007f4788bca000)
        libtermkey.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtermkey.so.1 (0x00007f4788bbd000)
        libunibilium.so.4 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libunibilium.so.4 (0x00007f4788ba6000)
        libtree-sitter.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtree-sitter.so.0 (0x00007f4788b78000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f4788521000)
        libluajit-5.1.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libluajit-5.1.so.2 (0x00007f4788aec000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4788340000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f4788ae7000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4788ae0000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4788c61000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f4788ac0000)
```

This Neovim in Debian bookworm uses 0.1.4 version of [libvterm](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/) which is the one found in Debian bookworm.

### Why Debian Neovim package is stack in 0.7.2.

The Debian bookworm/testing uses the [upstream Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) v0.7.2 release (2022-06-27) which requires to use 0.1.4 version of [libvterm](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/).  The 0.1.4 version of libvterm is available in bookworm/testing repository as of 2023-04-09.

The newer upstream Neovim v0.8.0 release (2022-10-01) requires to use 0.3 version of [libvterm](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/).

The latest upstream Neovim v0.9.0 release (2023-04-07) requires to use 0.3.1 version of [libvterm](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/).

The 0.3.1 version of libvterm isn't available in bookworm/testing nor unstable/sid repository as of 2023-04-09.

This is the cause of Debian Neovim/testing to be stack in 0.7.2 as of 2023-04-11.

The 0.3.1 version of libvterm is available in experimental repository as of 2023-04-09.

So it is possible to build Neovim using experimental repo.

You should be able to build Debian package using the essentially the same code
in `debian/*` after updating it to cope with new upstream source tree for
post-build testing. Following packages are needed:

* build-essential
* cmake
* ninja-build
* libc6-dev                bookworm
* libluajit-5.1-dev        bookworm
* libmsgpack-dev           bookworm
* libtermkey-dev           bookworm
* libtree-sitter-dev       bookworm
* libunibilium-dev         bookworm
* libuv1-dev               bookworm
* lua-luv-dev              bookworm -- needs extra cmake options
* libvterm-dev             experimental (0.3.1-1) -- needs this version

External library dependencies are linked dynamically for this case.

### Upstream Neovim DEB-package

**No more** (There were DEB package up to **8.3** but no more on 2023-09-03)

Upstream provides DEB-packages for Linux (x64) == amd64 platform at:

* [Nvim release build](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable)
* [Nvim development (prerelease) build](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/nightly)

External library dependencies are linked statically.


## Local build of Neovim DEB-packages using CMake

Since [upstream Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is fast moving
platform, it is nice to have its latest version.

Upstream repository situation on 2023-04-11.

* branch
  * master (branch head builds candidate for v0.10.0)
  * release-0.9 (branch head builds candidate for v0.9.1)
* tag
  * nightly (on master branch)
  * stable (on release-0.9 branch)
  * v0.9.0 (same as stable at 2023-04-11)
  * v0.8.3
  * v0.8.2
  * v0.8.1
  * v0.8.0
  * v0.7.2
  * ...

### External dependencies as shared library

When building Neovim, you need to provide options to configure Neovim source to
match header and library file locations on Debian. Initial `cmake` needs to be
executed with following options.

```sh
$ GENERATOR="-G Ninja"
$ BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
$ DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH=x86_64-linux-gnu
$ cd path/to/source
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake \
  $GENERATOR \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$BUILD_TYPE \
  -DBUSTED_OUTPUT_TYPE=nvim \
  -DLIBLUV_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/lua/5.1/luv.so \
  -DLIBLUV_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/include/lua5.1 \
  -DPREFER_LUA=OFF \
  -DCOMPILE_LUA=OFF \
  "$LOGLEVEL" ..
$ cpack -G DEB
$ sudo dpkg -i nvim-linux64.deb
```

This configure source to use -dev packages and build a binary executable linked
to shared libraries like normal DEB-package build via `debian/*` for the official Debian repository.

### External dependencies as statically linked library

Statically linking external libraries frees us from library version mismatch
troubles.

Here is how to build such Neovim by oneself.

Let's build Neovim as described in
[Building Neovim: Quick start](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#quick-start)
for Developer.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
$ cd neovim && make CMake_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
$ cd build
$ cpack -G DEB --verbose
$ sudo dpkg -i nvim-linux64.deb
```

This `cpack -G DEB` is probably how upstream builds its DEB-packages.

Now (2023-04-09), this builds the latest Neovim master branch on git repo
(0.10.0-dev version) with all external libraries statically linked.


```sh
$ bin/nvim --version
NVIM v0.10.0-dev-19+g339011f59

LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3

   system vimrc file: "$VIM/sysinit.vim"
  fall-back for $VIM: "/usr/local/share/nvim"

Run :checkhealth for more info
```
Let's see what was built.

```sh
$ ldd bin/nvim
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff131a7000)
    libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f4860921000)
    libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f48610b0000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4860740000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f48610ed000)
```

## Caveat of DEB-package made by CMake

The DEB-package build by CMake doesn't use some package features.

* update-alternatives mechanism
* package dependency (conflict-related features)

Before installing DEB-packages build by CMake (including ones built by
upstream), you must remove both Debian `neovim` and `neovim-runtime` packages
in advance to avoid package conflicts.

Since command normally provided by the update-alternatives are not available, `view`, `vimdiff`, `ex`, and `editor`
commands needs some workaround such as the use of alias defined in `~/.bashrc`:
```sh
# nvim: nvim with LazyVim -- as /usr/bin/nvim
export EDITOR=nvim
export VISUAL=nvim
# `vi` as neovim with LazyVim
alias vi='nvim'
# `v` as neovim without resource file
alias v='nvim  -u NORC'
# `v0` as neovim with minimum resouce file
alias v0='nvim -u ~/.nvim'
# sudoedit to use nvim w/o resource file
alias svi="SUDO_EDITOR='/usr/bin/nvim -u NORC' /usr/bin/sudoedit"
# vim alias
alias vimdiff='nvim -d'
alias view='nvim -R'
alias ex='nvim -e'
alias editor=nvim
```
This should force to use Neovim as the backend of `vim`-related command.

## Automating nvim build

I made a simple script to build DEB-packages:

* https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/neovim-ninja (REV 1)
