Let's review a few interesting plugins.

Please note that I manage plugins via GUI reconfiguration framework using the
`vimconf` command.  See
[osamuaoki/dot-vim](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim).  I admit my scheme
is not the main stream one.

Please note very basic configuration is at
[~/.vim/vimrc](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/vimrc).

All other initialization code is provided as plugin.

## `osamuaoki/00-vimrc`

My kitchen sink initialization
[script](https://github.com/osamuaoki/00-vimrc/blob/master/plugin/00-vimrc.vim).

### Map non-starter TAB in INSERT MODE

I follow the vim manual with some twist to map non-starter `TAB`. (`:h
ins-completion`):

```vim
" Auto complete <C-N> with <TAB> if tailing non-space character
function! CleverTab()
  if strpart( getline('.'), 0, col('.')-1 ) =~ '\(^\|\s\)$'
    return "\<Tab>"
  else
    return "\<C-N>"
  endif
endfunction
inoremap <Tab> <C-R>=CleverTab()<CR>
" Auto complete <C-P> with <S-TAB> if tailing non-space character
"
function! CleverSTab()
  if strpart( getline('.'), 0, col('.')-1 ) =~ '\(^\|\s\)$'
    return "\<S-Tab>"
  else
    return "\<C-P>"
  endif
endfunction
inoremap <S-Tab> <C-R>=CleverSTab()<CR>
```

### Map a key sequence to ESC in INSERT MODE

Pressing `ESC`-key to get back to NORMAL MODE from INSERT MODE is a bit
stressful since it is far from the finger home position.  I map a quick key
sequence of "`kj`" to `ESC`-key.

```
inoremap kj  <Esc>
inoremap kjk kj
```

The second mapping is to allow quick input of `kj` by `kjk`.  Without this, you
need to wait a second after entering `k` to enter `kj`.

`k` and `j` are easiest to type and unlikely under normal input situation.  I
remember this as my __Knee-Jerk-reaction__ to the distant `ESC`-key.

### Map a key sequence to `^WN` in TERMINAL MODE

Similar key sequence trick proposed for INSERT MODE can also be implemented
```
tnoremap kj  <C-W>N
tnoremap kjk kj
```

### Map `Q` to `@q` in NORMAL MODE

Record and apply keyboard MACRO just with `q`-key. ("qq" to start recording
MACRO, "qq" to quit recording MACRO, "Q" to apply MACRO)
```
nnoremap Q @q
xnoremap Q :norm @q<cr>
```

## `ciaranm/securemodelines`

Features like "modeline" is very convenient but it may become source of
security concern.  This plugin disables Vim's native capability for "modeline"
but still enables very limited commands to be parsed.

Since this works even under "`:set nomodeline`" default start scheme, I am
using this all the time.

## `ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace`

This is a new improved version of `bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace` .  This
takes care all weird UTF-8 spaces too.

* Mark all types of spaces in wrong position on display.
* Strip tailing spaces upon hitting "`<SPACE>s`" only.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-better-whitespace)
for an example configuration.

My configuration marks all problematic spaces but only remove problematic
dangling spaces upon explicit user request.  (So the annoyance noticed by #vim
Recommendations is addressed.)

## `nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides`

This is a plugin for visually displaying indent levels in Vim.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-indent-guides)
for an example configuration.

Unlike using vim native approach of "`:set list`" with "`:set listchars=...`"
to visualize TAB and tailing spaces, `vim-better-whitespace` and
`vim-indent-guides` doesn't cause problem when selecting screen area with
mouse-drags.

## `osamuaoki/vim-spell-under`

When syntax highlist and spell checker are activated together, text becomes
difficult to read in some cases in terminal.  This forces spell checker to use
underline.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-qlist)
for an example configuration.

## `romainl/vim-qlist`

Native behavior of `[I`, `]I`, `[D`, and `]D` to search the keyword and the
macro definition is a bit half baked.  It should be much nicer if it allows to
jump to pertinent positions as in the QuickFix list.

This script replaces these NORMAL MODE commands with more desirable behavior
ones of the QuickFix list.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-qlist)
for an example configuration.

## `vim-airline/vim-airline`

I understand this is only visual sugar candy and not much functionality
improvement as Gurus told me.

But it was irresistible ... sigh ... forgive me for my weakness.  I try to use
this with minimal complications, though.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-airline)
for an example configuration.

`vim-airline/vim-airline-themes` is not shown in menu but automatically pulled
in if `vim-airline/vim-airline` is used.

Other similar packages such as `rbong/vim-crystalline` and
`itchyny/lightline.vim` require you to write custom script from scratch and if
such scripts are added, their claimed advantages may not be true any more.

If I need really light statusline, I use bare monochrome static status line
string with vim internally defined items (defined in `~/.vim/vimrc`).  If
vim-airline is active, this setting is overridden.

## `tpope/vim-fugitive`

This allows to issue `git` commands from Vim command line.  The following may
be most useful.  If you have a command or alias "`αβγ`" for `git` command, it
works as "`:Git αβγ`" and in its short form "`:G αβγ`" under Fugitive.

* `G[status]`: 2nd top window with "`git status`" data.
* `G[it] commit`: Wrapper for "`git commit`".
* `G[it] commit -–amend`: Wrapper for "`git commit -–amend`".
* `Gblame`: 2nd side window with "`git blame`" data.
* `Gdiff`: Nice diff display with git HEAD data.
* `Gmerge ...`: "`git merge ...`" with QuickFix list.
* `Gread`: Discard editor buffer contents and read from Git HEAD
* `Gwrite`: Write the file and "`git add`" for it sensibly.

## `airblade/vim-gitgutter`

Checks diff from the repository contents asynchronously without blocking editor
response and mark changed lines.

## `dense-analysis/ale`

Very nice syntax checker.
