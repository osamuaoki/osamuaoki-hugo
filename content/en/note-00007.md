Let's review a few interesting plugins.

Please note that I manage plugins via GUI reconfiguration framework using the
`vimconf` command.  See
[osamuaoki/dot-vim](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim).  I admit my scheme
is not the main stream one.

Please note very basic configuration is at
[~/.vim/vimrc](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/vimrc).

All other initialization code is provided as plugin.

## `osamuaoki/00-vimrc`

My kitchen sink initialization
[script](https://github.com/osamuaoki/00-vimrc/blob/master/plugin/00-vimrc.vim).

## `ciaranm/securemodelines`

Features like "modeline" is very convenient but it may become source of
security concern.  This plugin disables Vim's native capability for "modeline"
but still enables very limited commands to be parsed.

Since this works even under "`:set nomodeline`" default start scheme, I am
using this all the time.

## `ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace`

This is a new improved version of `bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace` .  This
takes care all weird UTF-8 spaces too.

* Mark all types of spaces in wrong position on display
* Strip tailing spaces upon hitting "`<SPACE>s`".

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-better-whitespace)
for an example configuration.

Basically, I mark all problematic dangling spaces but only remeve them upon
explicit request.

## `osamuaoki/vim-spell-under`

When syntax highlist and spell checker are activated together, text becomes
difficult to read in some cases in terminal.  This forces spell checker to use
underline.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-qlist)
for an example configuration.

## `romainl/vim-qlist`

Native behavior of `[I`, `]I`, `[D`, and `]D` to search the keyword and the
macro definition is an bit half baked.  It should be much nicer if it allows to
jump to pertinent positions like the QuickFix system.

This script replaces these with more desirable behavior which is compatible
with the QuickFix system.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-qlist)
for an example configuration.

## `vim-airline/vim-airline`

I understand this is only visual sugar candy and not much functionality
improvement as Gurus told me.

But it was irresistible ... sigh ... forgive me for my weakness.  I try to use
this with minimal complications, though.

See my
[configuration](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/conf/preconf.available/vim-airline)
for an example configuration.

## `tpope/vim-fugitive`

This allows to issue `git` commands from Vim command line.  The following may
be most useful.

* `G[status]`: 2nd top window with "`git status`" data.
* `Gblame`: 2nd side window with "`git blame`" data.
* `Gdiff`: Nice diff display with git HEAD data.
* `Git commit -a`: Wrapper for "`git commit -a`".
* `Git commit -–amend`:Wrapper for "`git commit -–amend`".
* `Git commit`: Wrapper for "`git commit`".
* `Gmerge ...`: "`git merge ...`" with quickfix list.
* `Gread`: Discard editor buffer contents and read from Git HEAD
* `Gwrite`: Write the file and "`git add`" for it sensibly.

## `airblade/vim-gitgutter`

Checks diff from the repository contents asynchronously without blocking editor
response and mark changed lines.

## `dense-analysis/ale`

Very nice syntax checker.
