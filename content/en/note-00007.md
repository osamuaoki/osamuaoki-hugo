Let's review a few interesting plugins.

Please note that I manage plugins via Vim 8's native plugin management
framework.

As of 2021-08-27, I enabled:

* ale
* vim-airline
* vim-airline-themes (automatic)
* vim-better-whitespace
* vim-indent-guides
* vim-spell-under

(vim-gitgutter is interesting but I don't work on repo with many contributors.)

Please note some basic configuration settings including plugin management are at
[~/.vim/vimrc](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/vimrc).

All other initialization code is provided as plugin.

Basic rule: Less customization is better.

For hard to reach Esc-key issue, use CapsLock for it via GNOME Tweak setting.

## `~/.vim/vimrc`

Let's list highlight of configuration.  Local configuration for each plugins
are also included in this
[~/.vim/vimrc](https://github.com/osamuaoki/dot-vim/blob/master/vimrc) file.

### Map `<F2>` to toggle PASTE MODE in INSERT MODE

Adjust PASTE MODE by `F2`-key.

```
set nopaste
set pastetoggle=<f2>
```

### Map `Q` to `@q` in NORMAL MODE

Record and apply keyboard MACRO just with `q`-key. ("qq" to start recording
MACRO, "qq" to quit recording MACRO, "Q" to apply MACRO)
```
nnoremap Q @q
xnoremap Q :norm @q<cr>
```

## `ciaranm/securemodelines`

Features like "modeline" is very convenient but it may become source of
security concern.  This plugin disables Vim's native capability for "modeline"
but still enables very limited commands to be parsed.

Since this works even under "`:set nomodeline`" default start scheme, I am
using this all the time.

## `ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace`

This is a new improved version of `bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace` .  This
takes care all weird UTF-8 spaces too.

* Mark all types of spaces in wrong position on display.
* Strip tailing spaces upon hitting "`<SPACE>s`" only.

My configuration marks all problematic spaces but only remove problematic
dangling spaces upon explicit user request.  (So the annoyance noticed by #vim
Recommendations is addressed.)

## `nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides`

This is a plugin for visually displaying indent levels in Vim.

Unlike using vim native approach of "`:set list`" with "`:set listchars=...`"
to visualize TAB and tailing spaces, `vim-better-whitespace` and
`vim-indent-guides` doesn't cause problem when selecting screen area with
mouse-drags.

## `osamuaoki/vim-spell-under`

When syntax highlist and spell checker are activated together, text becomes
difficult to read in some cases in terminal.  This forces spell checker to use
underline.

## `vim-airline/vim-airline`

I understand this is only visual sugar candy and not much functionality
improvement as Gurus told me.

I set the GNOME terminal's font to Hack.  Then non-standard glyphs becomes OK.

But it was irresistible ... sigh ... forgive me for my weakness.  I try to use
this with minimal complications, though.

`vim-airline/vim-airline-themes` is not shown in menu but automatically pulled
in if `vim-airline/vim-airline` is used.

Other similar packages such as `rbong/vim-crystalline` and
`itchyny/lightline.vim` require you to write custom script from scratch and if
such scripts are added, their claimed advantages may not be true any more.

If I need really light statusline, I use bare monochrome static status line
string with vim internally defined items (defined in `~/.vim/vimrc`).  If
vim-airline is active, this setting is overridden.

## `dense-analysis/ale`

**This is used a lot**

Very nice syntax checker.

I may need to check:

* https://www.vimfromscratch.com/articles/vim-and-language-server-protocol/
* https://github.com/rhysd/vim-lsp-ale
* https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp

## `romainl/vim-qlist`

**This has not been used much but interesting.  (commented out now)**

Native behavior of `[I`, `]I`, `[D`, and `]D` to search the keyword and the
macro definition is a bit half baked.  It should be much nicer if it allows to
jump to pertinent positions as in the QuickFix list.

This script replaces these NORMAL MODE commands with more desirable behavior
ones of the QuickFix list.

## `jceb/vim-orgmode`

**This has not been used much but interesting.  (commented out now)**

## NOT USED: `airblade/vim-gitgutter`

**This is not used but interesting. (not used recently under this configuration)**

response and mark changed lines.
