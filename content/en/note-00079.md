## `d-i` Rescue mode

Boot system with `d-i` (Trixie/13).  (For Sony Vaio, power up with `d-i` USB
key inserted with "ASSIST" button.)

* "Advanced options" -> "Rescue mode" -> ... (follow default selection)
* Enter passphrase for encrypted volume if asked.
* If "Do not use a root file system" is selected, shell (busybox) in in odd d-i
  environment
* If installed system root device is used, shell is normal but modification to
  root device is non-trivial
* Either way, booting to shell takes too much time.
