## Neovim v0.8.2 with AstroNvim v2.11.8

In order to update AstroNvim, Neovim needed to be updated v0.8+. Since the
official Debian package was stuck at v0.7, I installed upstream provided deb
package. See [Debian BTS #1021339](https://bugs.debian.org/1021339).

The following configuration was built on top of the configuration mentioned in
[Re-learning Vim (5)]({{< ref "note-00032.md" >}}).

### Local customization

I customized my Neovim with `~/.config/astronvim` and installed a few extra
packages as [astronvim-osamu](https://github.com/osamuaoki/astronvim-osamu).

Key local features:

- Unicode code point display in status line.
- Reopen file with its cursor at the last place.
- Vimhelp documentation available for delayed loading packages.
- Cheatsheet for Vim.

[vimdoc-install](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/vimdoc-install)
script to make all available Vimhelp documentation easily accessible via `:h`
by creating symlinks in `~/.config/astronvim/doc/` directories to them.

### Treesitter language support

Treesitter supports for pertinent languages were installed as:

```vim
:TSInstall {language}
```

See `:h nvim-treesitter`

### LSP/DAP/Linter/Formatter language support

LSP/DAP/Linter/Formatter supports for pertinent languages were interactively
installed by `<leader>pI` or `:Mason`.

Basically, this helps us to install requested `<packagename>` package into
`~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/<packagename>/` and make its executable
`<progname>` program accessible from Neovim in
`~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/<progname>`. So executable programs from Neovim
plugins are not the one on the main system.

In order this to work, some system programs are needed to be installed in
advance. As I see my situation with `:checkhealth mason.nvim` (after
`mason.nvim` has been delay loaded by opening a file).:

```text
mason: require("mason.health").check()
========================================================================

```

I ended up to install following Debian packages as required system programs.

- `luarocks`
- `npm`
- `nodejs`
- `cargo`
- `python3-pip`
- `python3-venv`
- `curl`
- `wget`

See more `:h mason.nvim`

In order to make LSP/DAP/Linter/Formatter programs accessible from shell
prompt, I have modifies `~.profile` to include the following:

```sh
# set PATH so it includes mason.nvim's private bin if it exists (Neovim/mason.nvim)
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/" ]; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

I got annoyed with automatic reformat upon file save.  The upstream gave me a
[lesson](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/issues/1572) pointing me to a
[solution](https://astronvim.com/Recipes/advanced_lsp#disabling-formatting-for-a-list-of-language-servers).

I also added
[~/.editorconfig](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/dot/.editorconfig)
to cope with sources using [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

## AstroNvim v3 branch with lazy.nvim

It looks like AstoNvim is migrating to the new package manager `lazy.nvim` as I
see its v3 branch development.

Once we migrate, files under `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer` seems to be
safely removed after migration.
