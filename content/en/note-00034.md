## Neovim v0.8.2 with AstroNvim v2.11.8

In order to update AstroNvim, Neovim needed to be updated v0.8+.  Since the
official Debian package was stuck at v0.7, I installed upstream provided deb
package.  See [Debian BTS #1021339](https://bugs.debian.org/1021339).

The following configuration was built on top of the configuration mentioned in
[Re-learning Vim (5)]({{< ref "note-00032.md" >}}).

### Local customization

I customized my Neovim with `~/.config/astronvim` and installed a few extra
packages as [astronvim-osamu](https://github.com/osamuaoki/astronvim-osamu).

Key local features:

* Unicode code point display in status line.
* Reopen file with its cursor at the last place.
* Vimhelp documentation available for delayed loading packages.
* Cheatsheet for Vim.

[vimdoc-install](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/vimdoc-install)
script to make all available Vimhelp documentation easily accessible via `:h`.

### Treesitter language support

Treesitter supports for pertinent languages were installed as:

```
:TSInstall {language}
```

See `:h nvim-treesitter`

### LSP server support

LSP server supports for pertinent languages were installed as:

```
:Lspinstall {language}
```

See `:h mason-lspconfig.nvim`

Some local Debian packages were installed as backend programs for LSP.

* `shellcheck`
* `shfmt`
* `black`
* `isort`
* `pyright` via pip

I also added
[~/.editorconfig](https://github.com/osamuaoki/osamu-utils/blob/main/dot/.editorconfig)
to cope with sources using [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/).
