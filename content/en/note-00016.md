## How to fill widgets into header of GUI

Let's get back to the `simple1.py`/`simple1.ui` example and change it to make a
`simple3.py`/`simple3.ui` example by adding following widgets to the header bar.
* [GtkLabel](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Label.html) under the "Display" button
* [GtkFileChooserButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/FileChooserButton.html) under the "Control" button
* [GtkButton](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Button.html) under the "Control" button

For this `simple3.py`/`simple3.ui` example, let's rename IDs in the XML file to
the lowercase and rename class name as `s/1/3/g`.  This is much more efficient
if you use the text editor instead of clicking through Glade.  This is trivial.

For the header bar,
[GtkHeaderBar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/HeaderBar.html)
under the "Containers" button seems to be the one to use.  Tricky part is how
to use it.  You don't put the HeaderBar widget into the Gtk.Windows class as
usual.  You put it aside.

The rest of operations are pretty much routines.

### How to create GUI program

Now we are ready to use this Glade origin header bar widget from `simple3.py`
by `header = Gtk.Template.Child()`:

{{< snippet "examples/glade/simple3.py" >}}

Since we use the same name for the assigned variable and the ID in XML,
`Gtk.Template.Child()` takes no argument now.

Running this with `python3 simple3.py` will start the GUI as:

Please play with this GUI while looking at your terminal outputs.

## How Glade generated XML looks

Just in case I forget which items were selected via Glade session, here is the
Glade generated XML `simple3.ui`:
