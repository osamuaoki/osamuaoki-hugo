Let me keep up note on configuring and administrating my ThinkPad T14 Gen 1
(AMD) under Debian GNU/Linux.  This is hardware specific tips.

My system has 2 NVMe SSDs:

* AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 PRO 4650U -- 6 cores, 12 threads
* 32GB (PC4-25600 DDR4 SDRAM) -- after adding aftermarket 16GB SDRAM
* WDC PC SN520 SDAPMUW-128G-1001 (20370001) -- Original Western Digital 128GB SSD
* TS2TMTE220S (42B8T4EA) -- Aftermarket Transcend 2TB SSD

## Official Information Sources

## Adding 2TB SSD (2280 both side)

The original Western Digital 128GB PCIe SSD (2242, IC on top side only) is
removed and moved with thermal pad to the unused PCIe slot intended for WAN
card.

The aftermarket Transcend 2TB PCIe SSD (2280, IC on top and bottom sides) is
installed to the original SSD slot.

## Distribution selection

In order to have decent graphics support easily, current testing distribution
(bullseye) is used.

```
$ uname -a
Linux goofy 5.9.0-5-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.9.15-1 (2020-12-17) x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Non-free firmwares

I think we need some non-free drivers.

* `firmware-amd-graphics`  --- GPU
* `firmware-iwlwifi`  --- WIFI ?
* `firmware-misc-nonfree`  --- ?
* `firmware-realtek`  --- NIC ?
* `amd64-microcode`  --- CPU

## Network configuration

Since there are 2 Ethernet devices (one on right side and one accessible from
docking station), I updated `/etc/network/interfaces` as follows to make them
hot-pluggable.

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# GNOME
### The network interface on normal port
allow-hotplug enp2s0
# This is an autoconfigured IPv4 interface
iface enp2s0 inet dhcp
# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface
iface enp2s0 inet6 auto

### The network interface on extra port
allow-hotplug enp2s0f0
# This is an autoconfigured IPv4 interface
iface enp2s0f0 inet dhcp
# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface
iface enp2s0f0 inet6 auto
```

## Audio configuration

GUI setting tools provide nice and easy control of the sound system under the
normal situation.  But it doesn't provide access to detailed system system
settings nor control on them.

The console program `alsamixer` gives full control on internal sound devices on
modern PC.

### Adjusting sound level with `alsamixer`

Use `alsamixer` from terminal console to set proper volume:
 * `F6` -> `1  HD-Audio Generic` -> `Master`, `Headphone`, `Speaker`, ... with left/right-arrows -> Up-arrows to set to `00` (100)

### Mute and unmute sound with `alsamixer`

Use `alsamixer` from terminal console to mute and unmute:
 * `F6` -> `1  HD-Audio Generic` -> Select `Master`, `Headphone`, `Speaker`, ... with left/right-arrows -> Press-`m` to toggle `M`

## Sound system regression (Dec-2020)

We experienced a sound system regression of missing analog audio output
incident in late-2020 for T14.  The root cause seemed to be the mismatch of the
kernel version and the udev script.

This problem seems already fixed in Feb-2021.  The below  are my my workarounds
for this issue.

FYI: I also suffered strange muting behavior which required me to use
`alsamixer` to fix it. (See above)

### Workaround (rev. 1: manual)

I run the following from console after installing `pulseaudio-utils` once for
every booting manually:

```
 $ pactl load-module module-detect
```

### Workaround (rev. 2: automatic)

Although modifying a distribution provided file as workaround is not my
favorite move, I did it anyway to make this workarund automatic.

Modify `/etc/pulse/default.pa` as follows:

```
$ cd /etc/pulse/
$ diff -u default.pa.orig  default.pa
--- default.pa.orig	2020-02-06 11:06:41.000000000 +0900
