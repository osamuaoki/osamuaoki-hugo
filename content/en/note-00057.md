I researched on the current tool choices for RDP/VNC.

## GUI remote access client

| Package name       | RDP   | VNC   | SSH   | SPICE | command (menu)    |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| `vinagre`            | YES   | YES   | YES   | YES   | `vinagre` (remote desktop viewer) archived upstream |
| `remmina`            | YES   | YES   | YES   | ---   | `remmina`           |
| `virt-viewer`        | ---   | YES   | ---   | YES   | `remote-viewer`     |
| `gnome-connections`  | YES   | YES   | ---   | ---   | (connections)       |
| `krdc`               | YES   | YES   | ---   | ---   |                   |

BASICS:
- [RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol): originally Windows focused
- [VNC (Virtual Network Computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing): originally Linux focused, uses [RFB protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFB_protocol)
- [SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Protocol_for_Independent_Computing_Environments): QEMU focused.  See [Spice for Newbies](https://www.spice-space.org/spice-for-newbies.html)

NOTE:
- `gnome-connections` was split out from `gnome-boxes` and is the choice for RDP and VNC on GNOME
- `remote-viewer` is the choice for SPICE on GNOME
- `vinagre` and `remmina` are reasonable choice on non-GNOME platform
- Keep away from very outdated `rdesktop` and `grdesktop`.
- All modern RDP clients are based on freerdp library as their backend

## RDP/VNC server

- GNOME has moved from `vino` package (VNC) to `gnome-remote-desktop` package (RDP).
  - Enable RDP feature from CLI using `grdctl`(1) on GNOME.
- If RDP server is needed for non-GNOME platform, use `xrdp` package.
  - Use `xrdp`(8) to run RDP server.
- If VNC server is needed, `tigervnc` seems to be a reasonable choice. (`x11vnc` is archived)
- [popcon stats](https://qa.debian.org/popcon-graph.php?packages=gnome-remote-desktop+vino+xrdp+tigervnc-common&show_installed=on&want_legend=on&want_ticks=on&from_date=2020-01-01&to_date=2023-12-31&hlght_date=&date_fmt=%25Y-%25m&beenhere=1)
