## Client-side decoration with GtkHeaderbar using Glade

Let's consider to add client-side decorated
[GtkHeaderBar](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/HeaderBar.html)
and to put primary menu with
[GtkPopover](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/Popover.html).

This isn't intuitive but I think I figured out.  So I made some postings.
* [Can't add GtkHeaderBar to "Client side window decoration" area](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=991468)
* [Can't add GtkHeaderBar to window with existing widgets / containers](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade/-/issues/499)

Let's use Glade to design GUI.  The GtkHeadBar can be placed anywhere on Glade drawing area but placing it at the end of normal window widgets makes touching up its UI XML file with the text editor easy for me later.

(Although it looked easier to reorder widgets via the text editor cut-and-paste initially, it is actually easier to play with "Pack type" and Position" in Packing tab of involved widgets.)

![Glade initial GUI design](/img/head-start.png)

Activating the "Client-side window decorations" checkbox creates odd __non-editable__ blank area inside the window.  Trying to put a widget there causes the error message as follows:

![Glade not woring as expected](/img/head-csd.png)

This seems to be intentional design of Glade to deal newly introduced XML structure support with minimal efforts on time.

Please look into the UI XML file after above change.  There is an odd XML tag `<placeholder/>` which has been added inside of the newly added `<child type="titlebar">...</child>`-tag pair.  This meaning of `type="titlebar"` is found in [GtkWindow](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/Window.html#class-details) as:

> The __Gtk.Window__ implementation of the __Gtk.Buildable__ interface supports setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Generated with glade 3.38.2 -->
<interface>
  ...
  <template class="window" parent="GtkWindow">
    <property name="can-focus">False</property>
    <child>
      ...
        <child>
          <object class="GtkHeaderBar" id="header">
            ... (snipped)
          </object>
          <packing>
            <property name="expand">False</property>
            <property name="fill">True</property>
            <property name="position">4</property>
          </packing>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
    <child type="titlebar">
      <placeholder/>
    </child>
  </template>
</interface>
```

This `<placeholder/>` is sloppy but practical Glade support of "Client-side window decorations".

Since Glade seems to expect us to manually touch-up this XML file, let's do it.

First move `<child><object class="GtkHeaderBar" id="header">...</child>`
to just after `<placeholder/>` and
remove `<placeholder/>`.

Then remove now redundant `<child>` and `</child>` tags from newly moved
section.  Indentation is non-significant.  Glade also functions as a pretty
printing tool.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Generated with glade 3.38.2 -->
<interface>
  ...
  <template class="window" parent="GtkWindow">
    <property name="can-focus">False</property>
    <child>
      ...
    <child type="titlebar">
      <object class="GtkHeaderBar" id="header">
        ... (snipped)
      </object>
      <packing>
        <property name="expand">False</property>
        <property name="fill">True</property>
        <property name="position">4</property>
      </packing>
    </child>
  </template>
</interface>
```

Let's open Glade to see what happened.

![Glade with CSD titlebar](/img/head-titlebar.png)

__GtkHeaderBar__ listed in the left side widget list panel has __(titlebar child)__ added.  The __GtkHeaderBar__ widget placed at the top of the __GtkWindow__ widget in the center panel now.

Then I made some more routines such as setting up callback functions for
signals.

### How to create GUI program

Now we are ready to use this touched-up Glade origin GUI design XML file from `head_win.py`.

{{< snippet "examples/glade/head_win.py" >}}

Since we use the same name for the assigned variable and the ID in XML,
`Gtk.Template.Child()` takes no argument now.

Since we use different names for callback functions between Python code and UI
XML, `@Gtk.Template.Callback` takes argument such as `@Gtk.Template.Callback("on_button_clicked")`.

Running this with `python3 head_win.py` will start the GUI as:

![Run head_win start](/img/head_win_start.png)

Click on hamburger icon to open primary menu.

![Run head_win_click](/img/head_win_popover.png)

Please play with this GUI while looking at your terminal outputs.

## How touch-upped Glade generated XML looks

For the record, the full XML file `head_win.ui` is here.
