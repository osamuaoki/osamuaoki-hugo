## Python virtual environment

I finally get to use python virtual environment using `venv` module to be
created under `~/.venv/`. (I wanted to upload a package to pypi.org)

```sh
 $ apt install python3-pip twine
 ...
 $ python3 -m venv ~/.venv
 $ source ~/.venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ install --upgrade pip
 ...
(.venv) $ install --upgrade twine
 ...
(.venv) $ deactivate
```

System packages were current enough to cause printing
`Found existing installation: pip 23.0.1`,
etc. and no new packages were installed in `~/.venv`.

Anyway, I now know how to activate and deactivate python virtual environment.

My motivation to use `venv` was to get the latest `twine` for pypi.org upload.
It turned out that the system `twine` was new enough for pypi.org.
